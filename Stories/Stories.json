        "I just woke up from a dream that I was hired by Larry David to watch his backyard while he was away. A young version of Super Dave Ozborne was my assistant. We were supposed to build a gazebo over the outdoor shower that was next to a cliff, but a couple italian mob looking guys in a cement truck decided to use that area to dump waste water and young super dave thought it was the shower being turned on so he didn't get out of the way and he got a rash. I wouldn't let him use the pool to clean off so he rolled in the grass but he was allergic to the grass and he started to swell up. For some reason there was an outdoor bathtub with a privacy wall and i told him to use that, while i chilled in the hot tub with Larry David's wife (the redhead). She was hitting on me and I reluctantly told her no because I didn't want to get fired, so she left pissed off. Then Young Super Dave came over and said he couldn't use the outside bathtub because Gallagher (the watermelon guy) was in it and wouldn't answer. So I told little super Dave to get me a rock to throw over the bathtub privacy wall and he brought me a big rock, i said that's too big it will kill him, so he got me another rock but it was the same size, so I found a smaller rock myself. It goes over the wall and hits Gallagher and he is yelling and screaming, i explain its an emergency and he shouldn't be taking a bath in larry davids backyard anyway. We go hide for a bit because we thought Gallagher could have his mallet with him. When we got back the hot tub was cemented over completely, and  Gallagher was with the Cement truck guys and the redheaded wife up on the cliff pointing and laughing at us. I woke myself up from the dream by me yelling outloud, \"fuck you!\"",

        "Episode 1:\nBulma had a crystal which was taken from a volcano, she needs to protect it against a person, the person is trying to steal it. So she asked Goku, Vegeta and trunks to protect it.\n\nGoku, Vegeta and trunks are known as the strongest saiyans in the universe. They are in the middle of fight against an opponent, this fight is to protect a crystal because bulma needs it for her invention. Vegeta gets kicked in the groin and then kicked on the face, he flies back and falls near Goku who was already on his knees. Trunks charges towards opponent from behind, the opponent dodges the attack in the last moment and kicks trunks in the stomach, he falls on the ground, opponent kicks him again, this time the kick flies him towards Goku and Vegeta. The three warriors were beaten badly and they are struggling to stand up on their feet. It is very important for them to stop this opponent but they are not able to. This hurt their ego. Vegeta screams \"I trained so much just to get humiliated like this?\". The three warriors fought together agaist a single opponent and they couldn't deliver a proper punch on that opponent! \n\nVegeta in frustration screams \"dammit, she is just one woman, we are getting beaten down by a woman, pull yourself up\".\n\nTrunks responds: she is ruthless father, we stand no chance against her.\n\nThe opponent they were fighting, is a woman and she is Android 18. Goku, Vegeta and trunks are fighting together and yet they are struggling to put up a  decent  fight against her. \n\nAndroid 18: You boys are so weak, I have to get back to my business.\n\nVegeta gets frustrated, he stands up on his feet , after him, Goku and trunks stood up too and they were ready to attack. Vegeta charges with full power, he punches with left hand, she blocks it with her one hand, then he punches with right hand, she blocks it with her other hand, she holds Vegeta's fists tightly and pulls him closer and she kicks his balls real hard with her knees then she puts her high heels on his groin, which knocked him out, his hair turns back to black. After seeing what happened to Vegeta, the other two were little scared, she observed it and teases them. \n\nShe was wearing a bikini, she turns back and shakes her booty little bit by saying \"you coward cats, I'm not looking, you may attack me\". \n\nGoku: Shh. Don't attack, she will knock us out, we need a plan.\n\nAndroid 18 checks her watch for time, and she realises, she is getting late.\n\nAndroid 18: alright boys, I don't have time to play with you\n\nAndroid 18 charges towards Goku, Goku tries to block her but she gets to his back, Goku turns back in shock, then she punches his stomach so hard that his hair turns from blue to black and then he got knocked out. Immediately she rushes towards trunks and she kicks him in groin then punches him on face and knocks him out, he couldn't defend even single attack!\n\nGoku, Vegeta and trunks Inspite of being strongest warriors in universe, they were toyed around by an gorgeous looking lady.\n\nAndroid 18 then steals that crystal and calls bulma.\n\nAndroid18: I got what you need, the boro crystal. Uff, you asked those 3 to protect it, they couldn't put a decent fight against me. Go quickly and give them those senzu beans, they are in lot of pain.\n\nBulma was in shock that the three warriors couldn't fight one woman! \n\nAndroid 18 takes a pic of herself along with the knocked out men and sends it to bulma. Her caption was \"A blue bikini girl, beats the men Black and Blue\".\n\n...To be continued",
        "In July 2020, I was weeks away from being homeless because I was scammed out of a business deal by my ex. I had big plans with the money, like opening up a charity and managing it myself. That was going to be my new life. I didn't prepare for the worst. I was distraught, lost, vulnerable, and traumatized trying to cope and move on, especially during a pandemic. \n\nI was swiping on Bumble and there was an older gentleman that said he was in biotech. My best friend is in biotech and she needed a mentor. I nonchalantly matched with him and immediately said my friend wants to go into biotech and needs your help. I gave him her contact information and did not hit on him. He flew out to her city and met her saying he had business there anyways. He later admitted he met her to impress her so I'd want to meet him. My friend, unbeknownst to me, told him my story of abuse by my ex and Bumble guy wanted to help by paying my rent for a year. \n\nHe kept pushing for us to meet in person, but I was too depressed to see anyone. He would text me positive affirmations, which helped dull the pain and lured me into trusting him. Eventually I caved and met him. That's when he said he wanted to help me get back on my feet and pay my rent. We met a couple more times after that and looked at apartments. He said he wanted to do a lump sum payment so I wouldn't fear he'd renege on his promise like my ex. However, they had an issue with the building's website, so he went to monthly payments instead, which made me worry due to the power dynamic. \n\nI told him upfront I wanted to take things slowly due to the abuse by my ex. In the beginning he did respect that boundary, but then he would get aggressive and whiny if I wouldn't kiss him. Besides his pushiness, I did enjoy spending time with him. I'd see him multiple times a week and we'd hang out all day together. When he wasn't pushing for physical intimacy, it was great. \n\nI told him I wanted to take intimacy like a slow burn and he responded, \"How about like a Hibachi grill?\" It made me uncomfortable that my boundaries were a joke to him especially since I was vulnerable. After the lease was signed, that's when he felt more entitled to my body, which was troublesome. One night after dinner, he became drunk and forced himself on me while we were sitting on his patio. Thankfully, I got away and he took the hint and drove me home. \n\nDuring this time, I was still healing from my ex and the scam, so the last thing I wanted was to deal with more male drama. Some days it was hard to get out of bed and shower, so when he'd randomly ask me to meet for lunch last minute, it was painful. Everything was last minute to him and on his schedule. He was the type where I'd have to interview him the whole time and entertain, which is exhausting when you're depressed and numb. I did a test one time where I didn't ask him questions during lunch and the silence was deafening. He didn't ask me any questions, nothing. However, he did make sure to brag about how he wants to buy a NYC apartment for himself, how his company is booming, and that he wants to take himself out to get a luxury massage, all the while I am sitting there with my broken phone figuring out what to do with my life. Woe is me, I know (sarcasm.) \n\nEven though he could be self-absorbed during conversations, I did enjoy our company and if he had went at my slow pace, we could have dated. I would have needed at least 6 months to comfortably start physical intimacy, but he wanted it quicker.  He was 60, bald, short, and obese. He was not hideous, but I think I was realizing I preferred women, so it was a confusing time. I had always been shrill and not a sexual person, so him wanting physical intimacy was irking me. He once asked at dinner randomly if I was a passionate person. I asked what that meant. He said, \"Do you enjoy sex?\" My face dropped. I said I didn't have much of it in life and changed the subject. He told me in the beginning he wasn't paying the rent to try and sleep with me, but he wanted to give back and help people. I was naive to believe that, I know.\n\nAs my depression grew and the pandemic got scarier, I pulled back on meeting. Mind you, he was also physically testing people for Covid as a side business in the medical field. He would become angrier and more controlling the more I canceled meeting. The original version of him that would text me positive affirmations was gone. Instead, after I would be vulnerable telling him about my mental health and that's why I can't meet, he would text me taunting things reminding me he is \"only paying rent for 1 year.\" During this time, I was researching low income mental hospitals to check myself into. After I told him I wasn't doing well emotionally that day and I was turning off my phone to be alone, he scolded me an hour later saying it was a one-sided friendship because I didn't go down to the pool and serve him cold drinks, even though I told him my phone was off and he never told me he was thirsty or at the pool. It felt like he was creating this fantasy of who I should be in his head and if I didn't adhere to the script, he'd scold me. He admitted he was a romantic, so his intensity doesn't shock me looking back. \n\nThe last time I saw him in person was October 2020. His texts became more controlling and after he technically sexually assaulted me when he was drunk, I knew deep down I needed to avoid him. In 2021, he was taunting me by email saying he was sticking me with the bill of 1 month of rent at the end. I guess you could focus on semantics of him paying exactly one year of rent, but he originally promised to pay the entire leasing agreement, especially since he was the guarantor.  The lease was 1 year, plus two months free, so a 14-month lease. If he had kept his promise of doing a lump sum rent, we wouldn't be arguing over rent. I'm not surprised at how petty he was acting because he would foam at the mouth talking about how he screwed his ex-wife out of money in the divorce. I never saw someone so gleefully talk about hurting an ex-wife like that. He was confused why she wouldn't talk to him after the divorce. He wanted me to go to his daughter's graduation, most likely to rub in his ex's face he snagged a younger woman. I was the same age as his children. I did not go to the graduation and self-isolated. \n\nIn the end, I did scrap together money and pay the last month of rent myself. I could have fought him over it since he was the guarantor and legally responsible, but my mental health and physical safety matters more, especially since he had a key to the apartment. \n\nI am aware I sound like a jerk by my story, but you have to factor in my own mental health issues and abuse I was coping with. I really did not want to deal with also constantly convincing another man to respect my personal boundaries. And no, I never agreed to a secret quid pro quo of physical intimacy for rent. I am not writing my story for sympathy or to win anyone over. This is simply my rare story of a man on Bumble who paid my rent for a year. \n\nI move out tomorrow and move into a house in another city. Ironically, the man who owns the house shares the same name as Bumble guy. However, this man is married and I am living with his children, too. I have since found a job working at home, so I can pay the rent myself for at least the next 6 months. There are many days where I still can't get out of bed due to the past abuse by my ex, but I will work on it more.",

        "If you don't know about hoi4 The New Order search in Google.\n\n\nSome context: The Russian Republic is a free independent state which emerged in 1985, following the complete decolonisation of Eastern Europe by Germany. It is stretching over all of the former territories of the RK's Moskowien, Kaukasien, Wolgastaat, Ukraine and Belarus, also including Crimea and St.Petersburg. It has gained a permanent seat in the Security council of the Bund Der Nationen in 2005, and also joined the Zollverein and Europapakt(Einheitspakt succesor) following the historic accords of Kiev in 2009.\n\nThe Aryan Brotherhood rules the Rest Of Russia. It is known by the world as another Burgundy-style failed hermit state. It is almost completely isolated of the Rest of the world, as the Security Council of the Bund Der Nationen(UN equivalent in TNO) has imposed harsh sanctions on them, banning all imports and exports from the so called \"Russkiy Reykh\".\n\nOctober 29, 2021\n\nAnnalena Baerbock entered the wide atrium of the Volkshalle exactly at 4am, she has started her work at this time since 1 and a half years, when she won the Reichskanzler elections with her party \"Reichsunion f\u00fcr Demokratie, Gleichheit und Klimaschutz\".\nThe Volkshalle was a very huge building, it included the room for 589 deputees, an office for the Reichskanzler and the quarters of the Reichspr\u00e4sident.\nAnnalena went into the elevator, and as usually, went up to the 11th floor, where her office was. As soon as she entered her office, she instantly fell down on her office chair. Good Lord, the work as the Chancellor of the Greater German Reich was extremely exhausting... Annalena barely slept in the last 1 year, even on weekends, she could maximally sleep 4 hours.\nA knock on her door.\n-Please, come in.. - said Baerbock with a tired voice.\nPaul, her colleague and good friend, came in.\n-Frau Reichskanzlerin, Ma'am. There is an emergency, please, you gotta go to the conference room, now. \nAnnalena got instantly up, then almost tan to the conference room.\n-Which one, the digital or the normal? - she asked Paul while going out of the office.\n-The normal - he answered.\nAs the Reichskanzlerin of the Reich went into the conference room, all ministers stood up to greet her.\n-Thank you, let's start - said she while sitting down on her chair.\n-Ma'am... - started the defense minister. One of our reconaissance sattelites has witnessed a large amount of Brotherhood troops on the Russian Border, doing military exercices. This situation can break the stability of the region apart, perhaps it can be an even worse scenario than the Oil Crisis. We need to intervene, until it is too late.\n-Think about it again, Franz - answered Annalena. We have attacked the Russians, brutally held them in occupation for 30 years... You really think that they will let us station our troops again in their territory?\n-Well, president Alexey Navalny is not against dialogue, he understands himself the seriouseness of the situation. - stated the foreign minister Christian Lindner. Anyway, he's on the way to Germania now, he will be at the Airport in 2 hours, you will need to be there to meet him, Frau Reichskanzlerin.\n-Shit, and why haven't you told anything about this to me? - shouted Baerbock at Christian.\n-Ma'am, the information from the Space Force came only 3 hours ago. Concerning the emergency meeting at Germania, it was the propostion of Navalny himself, we argued that it would be a very good occasion to warm our relations with Russia - answered the Minister of Defense. \n-Well, go then, prepare the cars and red carpet. - said Annalena while standing up. The meeting is hereby finished.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...\n\nP.S. Please give feedback on my atory in the comments.",
        "So I was thinking about dreams. Everyone dreams about all weird things. Sometimes good and sometimes bad and rarely ugly ones where you die a horrible death or someone killed you. It\u2019s the ugly dreams people remember. \n\nRecently I had such a dream where I was shot to death. I woke up sweating and breathless. This made me wonder if dreams are really just dreams or some information passing tool between different versions of me living in different realities. Like one of me died a horrible death and passed the last few memories of his existence to all the versions of me in different reality to warn us off so that others can survive that fate. \n\nIn my dream, I went to Pakistan with my sis and brother in law to attend a party. I am from India and after reaching Pakistan, I forgot the way to the venue while roaming in the streets of Pakistan. I met a guy who was rich and powerful and told him what happened. He said he could help me find my sis and brother in law. So I agreed and we went on his motorbike and on the way he said he had to meet a friend of his and parked the motorbike in a parking area and went inside his friend\u2019s office while I was standing outside waiting for him. As I was waiting I saw my brother in law going I a car but he didn\u2019t acknowledged me. I thought I can catch him on the bike. As I started the bike, it took time to start and I lost my brother in law from my sight. I kept looking for him while riding the bike and after sometime I came back to the same parking area to pick that Pakistani guy who was helping me. As I parked the bike, he was sitting outside frustrated. I told him what happened and he said everything is fine and we have to wait in a public park which is across the parking area and told me to go there.\nAs I was walking to the public park I saw many people were staring at me and as I turned back to see what was happening, I heard multiple gun shots and I fell on the ground with blood all over. The people who shot me were undercover police and the Pakistani guy told them that I was a spy from India. He thought I took his bike and flee so he reported me to police. I woke up afterwards sweating.\n\nSo yeah, never going to Pakistan because I think it was a future version of me from different reality warning me and other versions of me to cancel any trip to Pakistan.\n\nAnyone else have nightmares about death and then starting avoiding the cause or path which leads to that location? \n\nSorry about my English, it\u2019s my second language.",

We were so scared and I just started driving as fast as can and left her at her house and the worst part of the story was I didn't finish the nut.",
        "\nRodger stands in total silence as the fires around him are put out and damage reversed by the four he had crossed the Veil with.\n\nAll the years he'd known Prince Fernando as a friend and loyal servant, never had Rodger suspected that the Prince of Rosa was gay in nature or that he would have bonded to someone from the other side. The idea of both made his skin crawl to some degree, but none as much as the latter. He shudders at the thought of telling the King and Queen both new facts he had stumbled upon but knew that it had to be done.\n\n\"Did anyone manage to place a tracker on either of them?\" Rodger says, as his eyes stay fixed on the spot Fernando and his unsavory mate once stood.\n\n\"I managed to, Commander,\" Stella says as she confronts him. \"Just barely, but I was able to place one on the savage.\"\n\n\"Exhalent,\" Rodger says, taking in Stella. She was a woman of blonde hair and pale skin, roots of an immigrant to Rosa Providence from somewhere across the Atlantic.\n\n\u00a0Before they had left Rosa, the Queen had given them one vile of her blood in order to track her son. Even though he had evaded them, they were able to place a tracker upon his mate. There was no way that Fernando would ever leave the side of his mate, especially one just now coming into their powers through the tither they shared.\n\nFrom the folds of his cloak, Rodger brought out an ink bottle, quill, and parchment.\n\nRodger focuses as he holds the ink bottle in his palm for the quill dip in. In haste the quill scratches away in midair on the floating parchment paper, taking down his message for the King and Queen.\n\nWhen the message is done, Rodger reads over it quickly to make sure all is in order. When he is satisfied, he takes out a coin etched with a crown on one side with the motto \"there is no pleasure without pain\" and the other side with a single rose bud.\n\n\"Delivery for King Alejandro and Queen Maria of Rosa,\" Rodger speaks loud and clearly. The coin slips from his fingers, whips through the air, and disappears with a loud pop. A second later a glass bottle materializes, the parchment rolls itself up, slides into the bottle, and a cork pops into place just before it vanishes with a pop similar to the first pop.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll head back to our ship,\u201d Rodger tells his comrades. \u201cWe will watch the tracker Stella placed until it stops moving, and we will bring home our prince and his savage. Is that agreed upon?\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d the other four say in unison.",
        " \n\n*Honestly got inspired to write this cause my Nana told me \"you don't have one Guardian Angel, you need 3!\" because I was telling her some stories about how I have almost died multiple times in my short life. Might not go anywhere with this, just thought it would be fun.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou know how they say that everyone has a guardian Angel watching over them? Well that\u2019s true\u2026 for the most part.\n\nMost humans have at least 1 Angel watching, but some of them have\u2026 more.\n\n\u201cHello Head Angle Sal, my name is Jack, and I\u2019m an Angel in training. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. I have been assigned to assist you.\u201d I say after descending from the heavens into the bedroom of a young boy in a small home. I look at the boys assigned Guardian Angel, expecting to see the definition of grace and beauty; however, that is not what I saw.\n\nHis wings were ragged, his hair hung in wires, he had deep bags under his eyes, and his clothes were a complete mess. Normally an Angel\u2019s appearance is unchanging from the day of their creation. It evolves, and each person that looks upon sees something different, but they normally aren\u2019t\u2026 this.\n\nSal stares intently at the sleeping boy, his body tense as if he\u2019s ready to pounce at a moment's notice. It\u2019s almost as if he hasn\u2019t even noticed me.\n\n\u201cExcuse me? Did you hear me, I\u2019m Jack. Your new assistant.\u201d\n\nHe turns to me, \u201coh thank the Father!\u201d He shouts almost in tears, \u201cfinally! Finally! Finally!\u201d He grabs my shoulders and begins violently shaking me, \u201cI haven\u2019t had an ounce of sleep in a decade! You\u2019d think we\u2019d get to rest when they do! But I can\u2019t! I never get a break! I\u2019m so haaaaaapppyyyyyyy\u201d at this point he\u2019s in full blown tears.\n\n\u201cBut, we don\u2019t need sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh you will. Trust me you will.\u201d He turns around to point at the boy \u201cJust spend one week with- where\u2019d he go!?\u201d He begins panicking and looking around, \u201cI take my eyes off of him for a moment! There he is! No! No! No! Get away from the window!\u201d Sal then summons a bitter cold gust of wind through the window.\n\nThe boy jumps back and begins rubbing his arms, \u201cbrrr, too cold.\u201d He shakes his head and crawls under his blanket.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I ask Sal, \u201cI thought we aren\u2019t allowed to directly influence the humans decisions?\u201d\n\n\u201cEeeh\u201d he says walking over and slowly closing the window, \u201cyes and no. We are *supposed* to do anything that would *directly* influence them. However, we are allowed to give them a little guiding hand every once in a while.\u201d He stares angrily at the boy lying quietly under the covers, \u201conly problem is that THIS one needs more of a shove than anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh come on, he can't be that bad.\u201d\n\nHe slowly raises his hand, and roughly grabs my shoulder, \u201cyou don't know man. YOU DON\u2019T KNOW!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, okay! I get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne week,\u201d he tells me, \u201cONE WEEK! One week and you\u2019ll see what I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing, whatever you say.\u201d\n\nHe lets out a deep sigh, \u201cJust, watch him. I\u2019m going to close my eyes for a little bit. Do not let him out of your sights!\u201d\n\n\u201cScouts honor!\u201d I say as I raise my hand.\n\n\u201cAlright, jus- *yawn* just- five minutes. Wake me in five minu\u2026\u201d with that he dozes off and just floats there in place. He lightly brightens and dims with each little snore he takes.\n\n\u201cHuh, I\u2019ve never seen an angel sleep before. First time for everything I guess.

How was your recreation period?\u201d\n\nThe diminutive mammal grunted and fluttered over to drop his personal items on the desk. \u201cIt was very, very human,\u201d Seven Trills replied.\n\nThird Sister laid her frill against her neck but didn\u2019t turn her head to put him in her sight range.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Seven Trills hissed as he turned on the disinfectant spray. \u201cVery human.\u201d\n\nThird Sister pointedly began tapping faster on her interaction console; however the Winged didn\u2019t take the hint. He stalked over to the hot air drier and rubbed his winghooks through his fur vigorously.\n\n\u201cThe transport ended up going to Azure Seventh-flap,\u201d Seven Trills went on.\n\nThird Sister was beginning to regret the social protocols that required her to show interest in the first place, but there were social expectations to be met. \u201cWhat is there of interest on Azure Seventh-flap?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cThere is a human recreation resort,\u201d Seven Trills explained. \u201cHuman Friend Helen informed us that it was a type of ancient, pre-mechanical age sporting area that allowed humans to get as close to flight as their thick-boned bodies allowed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would seem interesting to a Winged,\u201d Third Sister murmured.\n\n\u201cOne would think,\u201d Seven Trills clicked out. \u201cShe really pressed for it even after I pointed out that even on the equator the main bases existed below the freezing point of water for ninety percent of the local year.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Third Sister flicked her frill in recognition, \u201cyes, that is the planet that nearly killed the Cold-blooded Ones when they sent an expedition. I saw the images at the university. Isn\u2019t the surface constantly covered in crystallized water?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, snow,\u201d Seven Trills replied. \u201cThat is the main attraction. The unique surface tension and low density are what provide the conditions that allow humans to mimic flight.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut your body mass is so low,\u201d Third Sister observed with a dissatisfied click, \u201cthat even with a proper internal thermostat you would lose your heat so quickly that you might as well be a cold blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we knew it,\u201d Seven Trills said with a grimace as he flapped up to rest on her shoulder.\n\nThird Sister held out her frill in stiff indignation, but Seven Trills seemed to only take it as an invitation to droop against her neck. She reminded herself that he had been in the company of humans.\n\n\u201cWhy did you not simply outvote her?\u201d Third Sister asked.\n\n\u201cShe was so eager,\u201d Seven Trills explained with a tiny sigh. \u201cAnd we thought we would be able to get some amazing data on the human flight neural circuit to sell to the College of Mammalian Psychology.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid they accept the data?\u201d Third Sister asked, her interest reviving again.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get any,\u201d Seven Trills said, pressing his sensory horns into her outer membrane.\n\n\u201cWas she unable to participate due to injury?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe hates skiing,\u201d Seven Trills informed her. \u201cShe always has. The activity not only holds no attractions for her\u2026 she actively discourages other humans from participating in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did she wish to go to a planet with no other form of recreation?\u201d Third Sister demanded.\n\n\u201cDo you remember why the Cold-blooded Ones didn\u2019t die on Azure Seventh-flap?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe human expedition saved them,\u201d Third Sister replied. \u201cAh, did she wish to go for historical pride?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you remember how the humans saved them?\u201d Seven Trills pressed.\n\n\u201cI do not,\u201d Third Sister answered. \u201cI am not a memory keeper.\u201d She paused. \u201cI think it had something to do with humans having a superior transport device.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was part of it,\u201d Seven Trills confirmed. \u201cThe humans had sleds designed to run over the surface of the crystallized water. They were very effective, but none of the high energy engines worked due to the unique electromagnetic fields on the planet, and no combustion engine would ignite in the atmosphere.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how did the humans solve that problem?\u201d she asked.\n\nSeven Trills flipped over and pointed a personal projector at the wall. He activated it, and Third Sister clicked in surprise.\n\n\u201cI have seen those at the main university,\u201d she said. \u201cBut never this variation. An entire species dedicated to transport. Fascinating\u2026 I thought them medical aides and message carriers at best.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly this variation,\u201d Seven Trills began, \u201cthis breed is dedicated to transport, we learned.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what does their presence have to do with Human Friend Helen going to a base with no form of recreation she enjoys?\u201d Third Sister asked, getting tired of being a couch for the Winged.\n\n\u201cShe said,\u201d Seven Trills said with a groan, dropping one wing over his eyes, \u201cthat she desperately needed a doggo fix, and huskies would do as well as any other doggo.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you?\u2014\u201d He suddenly took off and darted around the room at mad vectors. \u201cDo you have any idea how much they drool?\u201d\n\nThird Sister began to back out of the room.\n\n\u201cOr how hard it is to get drool out of fur?\u201d he demanded. \u201cHuman Friend Helen laughed, but skin can be washed in cold weather! Fur\u2014\u201d\n\nThe rant cut off as Third Sister slipped into the corridor.\n\n# [Humans are Weird \u2013 Doggo Fix - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/QbDA9wbziBY)\n\nBook 1 \"[\u200b](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)Humans are Weird: I Have the Data\"\n\n[Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RSVHL81)\n\n[Barnes & Nobe (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/humans-are-weird-adelia-gibadullina/1138927933;jsessionid=CED1CA2DD868CAE60C7F4EAC8FEDD5E5.prodny_store01-atgap01?ean=9781736003923)\n\n[Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=USta%20eBook%20by%20Betty%20Adams%20-%201230004645337%20%7C%20Rakuten%20Kobo%20United%20States)\n\n[Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# [Humans are Weird: We Took A Vote BOOK 2 | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)",
        " This is the fifth chapter to my story Must I be the Villainess? You can find the first chapter on r/Abriella_Castoda or u/Abriella_Castoda. \n\n \n\nThe next few days after my last encounter with the male lead and the doctor were fairly calm. I spent my time at home, whether it was reading or knitting. I had meals by myself, fortunately. Only because of the accident, of course, but it was a great excuse to stay away from my \u2018parents\u2019. I enjoyed the tranquility of the days that had passed. Little did I know, I wouldn\u2019t be able to have tranquility for long. \n\n\u201cThe Master has requested to have dinner with you, madam,\u201d Mary said to me as I dressed for the day.  \n \u201cDid he say what it was about?\u201d I looked at her in the mirror.\n\n\u201cNo, madam. He just requested dinner with you.\u201d \n\n\u201cAlright, tell him I accept his request. Thank you.\u201d I really didn\u2019t want to go, but it wasn\u2019t really an offer I could decline at this point. \n\nWaiting for my dinner plans was always the hardest part of the day. I couldn\u2019t stand being in this new body. How did she interact with people before? I read the book. As far as I could tell, she had a decent relationship with her family. It was just a little colder since they were all nobles and they had the stereotype of being proper all the time. They didn\u2019t force her into an arranged marriage, which was popular at that time, so it showed they cared for her. Their own marriage was arranged, but they did well with each other. Based on the time I had been here, I would even say they became friends during their time as a married couple. Now, I had only seen this from a distance, but they seemed that way to me. \n\nBy the time dinner rolled around, I was such a nervous wreck. I wanted to throw up, but I attended. I walked into the large dining room. It had cream-colored walls with small decorations on them. The table was long and could seat many more people than necessary for our normal dinner. My father sat at the foot of the table and my mother sat next to him. *Where do I sit?* I looked down at the table and every place had a plate and a set of silverware. If I hesitate for too long, I\u2019ll look suspicious, so I had to choose a seat quickly. I sat across from my mother because it seemed like a safe choice at the time. No one stared at me like I was crazy, so I probably picked the right one.\n\n\u201cGood evening Sora. How are you feeling today?\u201d My father asked me.\n\n\u201cI am feeling a bit better. Thank you for asking.\u201d I replied, looking at the server who had set a large plate of salmon in front of me.\n\n\u201cA bit better? Do I need to send for Doctor Pruitt? Hm, no it must be a different Doctor because he said you had been healed.\u201d He seemed to be talking to himself, but his tone sounded as if the questions were directed at me. \n\n\u201cOh, no, I meant that I am physically fine. I just am still a bit tired, that\u2019s all. A new Doctor does not need to see me and Doctor Pruitt was thorough enough with his examinations. I would like to keep him as my doctor in the future\u2026 if that isn\u2019t too much to ask.\u201d My mother glanced at my father.\n\n\u201cWe were just worried about you. You hadn\u2019t been to dinner in a while. We will respect your wishes, but we didn\u2019t hire Doctor Pruitt as a family doctor. We can request him to come if you\u2019d like. Whenever you get sick, of course.\u201d She said. My father nodded, I guess to show his approval.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I replied cordially.\n\nI stared down into my plate, ready to eat this delicious salmon. Servers came and went, bringing new dishes. They were all wonderful\u2026 well, until they brought out the escargot. In my former life, I hated escargot with a passion. So I decided I was just going to avoid the dish altogether and focus on the others. I continued to eat when my father placed a few snails on my plate. I looked at him in shock.\n\n\u201cAnother plate of escargot.\u201d He commanded the server. He looked confused at my shocked look. \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t need to be shy. I know you love escargot. I ordered another plate so eat as much as you please.\u201d He turned back to his own meal and talked with my mother about the weather. \n\n*Snails?! The one thing Sora\u2019s father HAD to remember was that she liked snails?!* I didn\u2019t want to put these slimy, disgusting creatures in my mouth. I had before and I hated it! *Will I be caught if I don\u2019t?* The server quickly placed the extra plate of escargot in front of my father and he just slid the plate over to me. I realized then that I won\u2019 be able to get out of this. I stared down at it and picked up one of the smaller snails, took my fork, and dug the inside out of the shell. *Well, here goes nothing.* I stuck the fork in my mouth and chewed. To my surprise, it was delicious! Why did I like it all of the sudden? Is it that my body remembered liking this food? I grabbed another snail, and this one was bigger. I scraped out the insides and popped it into my mouth; chewed it slower this time to make sure I actually liked it. My father didn\u2019t lie! They were so good! By the end of the dinner, I had finished the ones on my plate and then the extra plate he had ordered. I was ready to go back to my room, full and pleasantly surprised until my father called my name just before they excused me.\n\n\u201cYes, Father?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had your debutante ball last year and you\u2019ve been putting off finding a personal knight\u2026 but it is time now. Especially now that you\u2019ve had an accident, I suggest you come with me to the knighting ceremony.\u201d He said this as a demand rather than a request. I looked at my mother and she avoided my gaze. *I guess they talked this over.* They probably expected me to throw a fit, but I didn\u2019t particularly care at the moment, so my reply was simple.\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go this year, IF you let me choose the knight.\u201d They both looked at each other, then looked back at me.\n\n\u201cThat sounds fair.\u201d He huffed his approval and excused himself. \u201cIt is getting late. I will return to my quarters. Good night, ladies.\u201d \n\nPleasantly stuffed and tired, I excused myself as well. I planned on reading after dinner, but now all I wanted was to sleep. Maybe being transported into this world wasn\u2019t terrible. If only I can escape my death, I would have a great life. Now all I had to do was pick a knight, which actually could work in my favor. That thought would have to wait for another day, because as soon as I made it to my room, I fell fast asleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this is a bit of a shorter chapter. Sorry! I was really sick this week, and I barely made the update time for Wattpad yesterday. I hope you guys enjoy it though! The next update will be on Monday the 1st. Until the next time! :D",
        "If you\u2019ve read any part of my \u201cPrison Stories\u201d you\u2019ll know that I am an ordained minister fully qualified to run and teach a Bible study and I help with Big Brother programs, reaching out to people who were abused, alcoholics, addicts, AA, AlAnon, etc. I have a soft spot for troubled people. I attempt to do what Christ would do, only I suck at it horribly. I am not trying to convert, actually I never tried to convert people. Your belief if yours and mine is mine. I can\u2019t change you and you\u2019re unable to change me. \n\nGays are ridiculed by the church constantly. I used to be one of those Christians, then I realized they are human beings and although we are all sinners, they are just as human as I am. Cut them, they bleed. And believe it or not, God does love them. So, I changed. I don\u2019t get it, I don\u2019t understand it, but if two people are in love, and as long as nobody is getting hurt, it\u2019s not my business. I\u2019m a pervert, they are perverts. \n\nI do Bible study every night, followed by Q&A about either the chapter we just read, about the Bible, Christ in general and a majority of the time, we just end up chewing the fat with stories and what if\u2019s. \n\nI used to get people confessing their past to me a lot. Asking if they can be forgiven, asking if they can receive Christ, if Christ will allow them another chance, etc. I got a lot of stories from a lot of people. Some were horrific in detail, others were quite innocent, while others made me want to strangle them (they were abusive to women or children). \n\nOne day, this huge muscular guy comes to me and asks for a few minutes. Regardless what I am doing, I always make time to speak to people. He blurts out, \u201cI am gay, I am in love, I want to marry this man and we want to live together.\u201d They\u2019ve both got 10+ years to go. This is a guy you\u2019d never think was gay. Huge, muscular, not handsome, not fit, unkept (straggly beard, stach, fucked up hair) while his fianc\u00e9 is one handsome motherfucker. If I wasn\u2019t straight, he\u2019d be what I would go after. Tall, handsome, accent, well kept hair, clean, the exact opposite of his guy. Politely, I ask, \u201cWith all due respect, what does this have to do with me?\u201d They explain that since I am an ordained minister, they\u2019d like me to perform a ceremony, and since I am somewhat connected maybe I could attempt to pull a few strings to get them to live together. Honestly, I was touched, honored, proud that they came to me. Still can\u2019t figure out what the handsome Spaniard wants with the giant white dude, but I can tell it was sincere. It wasn\u2019t about protection, money, etc. It was love. \u2018As far as the ceremony goes, I can do that at any time. But, let me see what I can do as a wedding present to get you two love birds living arrangements.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know this, but this handsome guy is the leader\u2019s brother (the leader of the Gay Boy Gangsters, Gay Army). The white dude is high ranking too, but homosexuality is frowned upon. While they do rape people, they swear they aren\u2019t gay. \n\nI go to my connects, who go to theirs and I even approached a few guards we were tight with. Why were we tight with the guards? I am an amazing chef. I make things on the fly, changing their menue when it\u2019s 10 or less. Plus the Christian Car runs the trustee program, and I participate in scared straight, I make sure the cars are super clean, make sure the locker room is super tidy at all times and any task I am given is done to perfection. A few even have arrangements with me that \u201cAnything left on the bottom shelf of my locker, is for you.\u201d Cookies, a few loose cigs, candy, magazines, items you wouldn\u2019t imagine a guard giving to an inmate. I even got busted with a cell phone in the sole of my sneaker and one guard let it slide like he never seen it. \n\nWith the help of the guards I can get the two living together, but one of the people in one of the cells has to agree to move out into the other cell. That\u2019s the hurdle. I can\u2019t get a white guy to get to agree to move in with a gay and vise versa. This is an issue. \n\nI decide to break a rule, the #1 rule. Snitch. But it\u2019s also a good thing I am doing, the good far outweighs the bad. I approach the main guard, big, bad, white, bald, scary almost nightmareish. But if he is on your side, you\u2019re aight. I am cool with him. I asked the two if they will be willing to move to another block and we have zero intel in that block, it\u2019s on the other side of the prison. We have zero intel. But we know there is room there through one of the lower ranking guards. He\u2019s a bad motherfucker if you cross him, but if you\u2019re a gentleman with him, show respect, take a little extra care of his uniforms, shine his shoes (like we do for all of them), he\u2019ll actually be respectful toward you. This guy give me the notice of the open two man cells, yet he doesn\u2019t even know who runs what set. \n\nA few kites (notes) are sent out. Think prison mail, no stamp necessary. 5 or 6 days later we get some intel and it\u2019s a mixed block, like ours and they don\u2019t have an issue so long as they follow the rules of no fighting, no stealing, no rape, etc. Same as our block. \n\nI approach the main guard. \u201cMay I speak to you privately, outside near the cars and 100% off the record?\u201d Without saying a word, he walks out opens the gates and lights a cig, offering me one. \u201cOff the record, shoot.\u201d I explain that I know how the heroin is coming in, only I don\u2019t know by who (I do, but wont go that deep), I just know when and how. But in exchange, I need two guys transferred to a different block, same cell, and a small get together in the chow hall after church. It\u2019s all I got. He nods yes, shakes my hand and says, \u201cDetails first. If it checks out, I\u2019ll make the arrangements within a week tops.\u201d I follow him back inside and am given a little extra detail work, only to find a pack of Marlboro Red at the bottom of his locker. This guy never gives anything, but this time he did. He knows the back story.\n\nI proceed to write a letter explaining that the heroin is coming in from the gardeners, the grass cutting crew and NOT the laundry as he suspected. Deliveries are on Monday and it\u2019s usually in a garbage back with a red rubber band around the neck, the rest are tied in a knot. This is all I know. I left the note in his shirt pocket. Next time I seen him, I get a nod. About 10 days later, there is a note on the bottom shelf of his locker. \u201cThe transfer will happen on the 7th of next month.\u201d We\u2019re on the 23rd, so two weeks. \n\nI go to the other guards and ask for permission for a small gathering in the chow hall after church. I let the boys know. Only 8 were invited (not including the couple and myself). But about 20 showed up. I\u2019ve got to teach, skip the Q&A, cook then get these two married. I teach, run in the back, the only thing I can make quickly is chili. The Gay Army shows up with about $100 bucks worth of commissary (prison groceries). Cakes, sweets, candy, and toilet paper mache flowers. They make roses out of toilet paper, but use M&M\u2019s soaked in water to get the dye off of the candy, then soak the TP in there and now you\u2019ve got colored TP that they shape into roses. Amazing work, I even sent a few to my wife. I lied and said I made it.\n\n\u201cYou two chicks ready to get married?!?\u201d We all enter the chow hall with 4 guards watching over us. Nothing fancy, nothing deep, just prayed that they truly fall deeper in love and that they find peace in one anothers love. I now pronounce you married! We danced a little, while I was uncomfortable dancing with men, I played along, then went into a circle dance (think like Greeks, Jews, Arabs) with one arm around the guy next to you and dancing in a circle. Corny, but for where we were and what we were, it was enjoyable. \n\nThe next night, they moved out. I got a little slack from the Wood Pile (Whites) but got monster pull with the gays. This got me a full treatment from the Gay Army free of charge. Haircut, shave, perfectly shaped Russian beard, threaded eyebrows, a dye job, nails, etc. All free. No grass and no ass. On the house, \u201cFor the sake of love.\u201d\n\nWe sad to see them leave, but we knew that is what they wanted. We were happy for them, but sad that they were no longer with us. Bittersweet, but more sweet than bitter. More like an aftertaste. The leader of the Wood Pile told me he didn\u2019t like what I did, but I told him, \u201cHe was always gay, it was a matter of time before he left you guys anyway. At least he is happy, be happy for him.\u201d He agreed, but asked who is going to replace the work he used to do? Our car doesn\u2019t do or put in work. I was scared but didn\u2019t show it just repeated, \u201cHe was leaving any way. The cock wants what the cock wants, am I right?\u201d This made him chuckle and it put me at ease about 5%. \n\nSeems like a happy story right? Well four months later, the handsome Spaniard walks back into our block crying like a baby. He starts to explain what happened, then he comes to me and says, \u201cThey murdered him in the yard. Stuffed a dead rat into his mouth.\u201d While I was heart broken, I feared for my own life knowing I was the rat that they were seeking and this lead me to realize that another rat, ratted the stipulations of the move out to whoever was dealing the H. I know who was dealing it, the Wood Pile. I know they arranged it, only I wasn\u2019t sure if they knew I was behind it. Only one way to find out. If I am going to die, I want to be prepared and take a few with me. \n\nNext day during yard time, I go straight to the leader of the Wood Pile\u2019s bench. Without asking permission, without talking to anybody. A sign of disrespect, a sign of trouble. \u201cYou just kill the guy and shove a rat in his mouth?\u201d Immediately he says, \u201cHey, we can\u2019t show weakness even when the cock wants what the cock wants. So the rat got what he deserved. Next time you come to talk to me, you come correct or you\u2019ll be corrected.\u201d He has no clue I was in on it. \n\nLater that week I am on car detail, I actually enjoy cleaning the cars. It\u2019s outside, in the sun, I pretend I am washing one of my own cars. The lead guard comes to me. \u201cIf you make a move, I\u2019ll be all over you and you\u2019re car is extinct.\u201d He just turns and walks away. He knew, this was his way of letting me know that he knew. Yet there was absolutely nothing I could say or do. \n\nFade out to \u201cLove hurts\u201d.",
        " \n\nWhen I was in high school, I found myself caught in the crossfire of a rivalry that I had no part in; one could say I was guilty by association. The group of guys that I associated with at the time - began feuding with two separate cliques, one being a gang of stereotypical shit-kicker white kids known as \u201cWoods\u201d and the other being a very unwelcoming group of gatekeeper punk kids. Because of my association with my then friends, I became a target from both sides. For a long stretch of time, I constantly looked over my shoulder, whether it was walking to class, walking home, or even walking to the bathroom. My head was constantly on a swivel. On one occasion, I received a knock at my door from unexpected guests that I was not too particularly excited to see. For - a lack of better terms, I had the displeasure of answering my front door to a small group of \u201cWoods.\u201d Upon answering, I tried my best to not seem overwhelmed by the situation. Whether it worked, I have no clue, but I tried my best to coast throughout the entire encounter. It turns out that a mutual friend of theirs who lived in the same neighborhood as me gave the rabble my address. I played the entire moment by ear, trying my hardest to not provoke anyone of my potential assailants. I watched the group\u2019s individual movements, their reactions to questions that were asked, and how they responded to answers I gave. Their goal was definitely intimidation, aside from humiliating me, but that\u2019s not too hard when you corner someone on their own doorstep. Either way, the situation went on for about 10 to 15 minutes and ended with threats of violence to not only myself but to my group of friends, eventually, my next-door neighbor who ran a grow operation out of his house grew a little too eager for his own good, saw what was happening and broke the whole thing up; I would be a liar if I said that his actions did not set my mind at ease. For months, things between both groups became tumultuous and spilled over into multiple fights and various heated encounters. Luckily for us, most of the group\u2019s members eventually either graduated, grew bored, or just didn\u2019t care to fight anymore; it was a roller coaster of events, but as a wise man once said: \u201cYou had to be there.\u201d",
        "NEW IDEA\n\nI wonder what I would have to do to make a speech in some way. A speech through personal experience used to convey an idea. An idea on why speech is truly important to us as humans. An \n\nexperience that involved both big ups and big downs that over time became a life. A life that isn't unique, important or special in the grand scheme of things. These events came from a religious\n\nperson and an ashiest, a child and an adult, a boy and a man, single to married, childless to a couple, sadness and happiness, anger and calm, stupid and intelligent but all from the same person. I don't do this for being boastful, prideful, Self-Grandesign, or anything else negative but purely for speaking my dumb thoughts and experiences. Call it a bored's perspective on life but \n\nloves fucking talking. I don't do this offend to which I most certainly will, it is what it is. Many will think me evil, the second coming of Satan himself or me awesome, when I piss you call it rain.....\n\nI care not, I do this for me mainly but I do hope anything I say means anything to anyone some way for the better. I truly believe me to a decent enough person but that is truly a flawed creature. I am not racist even though I say racist ass shit hahaha but its purely for comedy sake unless you truly earned it but everyone has their breaking points, hopefully you'll learn that in time. As I've said, I'm nothing special nor do I consider myself in anyway but what I do have a way of looking at things because of my retarded ass brain haha. ADHD is a hell of a drug and an addiction, hopefully one day I find a cure ha. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\tSo what must I do to start this autistic journey of a simple speech. I know that I must start just writing. Write what is on my mind currently, past or future. That's fun. I could just type this dribble to Reddit. Sure, fuck it. So Ill just write and post regardless of how people react. Odin knows I hate that place. Woke ass shithole. Will find others. Will update at whenever is best for me.",
        "\u201cTick\u2026 tick\u2026 tick\u2026\u201d, the sound of the clock ticking ran through the detention room. The room was dead silent, only filled with one other student and myself. The other student was sitting on the other side of the room not paying any attention to me or their surroundings. I would take a nap to save myself from this purgatory but the constant ticking of the clock ran through my brain like an alarm clock. \u201cTick\u2026 Tick\u2026 Tick\u2026\u201d\n\nI considered making conversation with the other student, but they didn\u2019t seem like much for conversation. They seemed around my age, 16 or 17, their short brown hair sat on their shoulders. The way they dressed and presented themselves made them look like your average innocent girl, but then we made eye contact. Her eyes were light blue but they might as well have been scarlet red. They had a sort of fierceness in them that would make anyone shiver. I could feel her judgment crawl down my spine. I quickly turned away not wanting to poke the beast anymore.\n\nI started to think about how I ended up here. I don\u2019t even remember, in all honesty, everything is kind of a blur. I know it was in the hallway, everything was normal and then it was all red. I remember the rage, the hatred, and anger flowing through my body, any humanity in me drained away as I became a savage husk of anger. I think I hurt someone, but I can\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t think I want to.\n\nFinally, the teacher walked in to save me from myself. He was a tall man with a stern face. You could tell he\u2019s been dealing with troublemakers for a while, and he wasn\u2019t going to crack. His voice was deep and imposing, \u201cYou know why you are here\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re here because the school needs to punish you while they figure out if you\u2019re worth expelling or not.\u201d. \u201cExpelled?\u201d I thought to myself. What had I done that set me up for expulsion? I could feel the memory trying to escape but was unable to reach the surface.\u00a0\n\nThe teacher once again spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ll be here for a few hours, exits are magnetically locked with the main office being able to unlock them once your time is up. Your phones are in the office as well, you\u2019ll receive them once detention is over.\u201d. The student next to me raised her hand. \u201cYes, Laura?\u201d Said the teacher, obviously annoyed. \u201cHow long do we have to do this for,\u201d said the girl presumably named Laura. \u201cYou both will be here until the school expels you or lets you off,\u201d said the Teacher. \u201cHowever, for some people,\u201d the teacher looked over at me \u201cexpulsion is more likely.\u201d.\u00a0\n\nI lowered my head in shame, I don\u2019t even know what I did and here I am being reprimanded for it. It happened this morning, only a few hours ago, so why can\u2019t I remember? Whatever I did wrong, it\u2019s going to cost me a lot. First I had to wait after school until 6, and now I have detention until 9. Now I\u2019m being told I could be expelled. I raised my head once I felt that the teacher\u2019s disappointing glaze had left.\n\n\u201cSo make yourself comfortable,\u201d said the teacher, \u201cI\u2019m going to be right back, I need to grab something from my car. Once I\u2019m back it\u2019s going to be 3 hours of silence.\u201d. The teacher walked out and closed the door behind him. The second the door closed the girl next to me laid back in her chair. After a few minutes of silence, she finally turned to me.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d She said, \u201cHuh?\u201d I responded. \u201cWhat did you do? What did you do to get here?\u201d I turned to her, her fierce eyes piercing through my soul. \u201cI... I don\u2019t know.\u201d I responded meekly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d She sounded annoyed like my answer offended her somehow. \u201cI- I-\u201c. \u201cI heard a rumor about you,\u201d she said, \u201cI heard they are holding you here because they are waiting for the police to figure out what to do.\u201d. I looked at her hoping to see that she was joking, but the intensity in her eyes said otherwise. \u201cI also heard about what you did.\u201d. Her eyes turned from fierce to straight-up hatred. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s true you\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t bash your head against a wall for what you did.\u201d.\u00a0\n\nWith this comment, I stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going to find the teacher,\u201d I said. \u201cThe teacher won\u2019t save you from responsibility.\u201d Said Laura. I turned away from her and began to exit the room when she let out one more remark. \u201cYou know it\u2019s ironic, you didn\u2019t want to lose your friends to her. Yet you lost them anyway.\u201d. I closed the door behind me. I felt sickened, those weren\u2019t just empty threats. Those were real.\u00a0\n\nI began walking towards the entrance of the school, letting what Laura said sink in. I didn\u2019t want to lose my friends to \u201cher\u201d? Who was her? Suddenly a memory unlocked, my brain finally allowing me to slightly remember what it was forcing me to forget. Bethany\u2026 her name was Bethany\u2026\u00a0\n\nBethany is a new girl at our school, and she is perfect. Super nice, super smart, and the sweetest little thing. She had recently integrated into my little friend group. Everyone in the group basically showered her in attention, but that wasn\u2019t a problem for me. She\u2019s just a new part of the gang and I don\u2019t have anything against her. I wouldn\u2019t hurt Bethany, she\u2019s my friend. I wouldn\u2019t. All these thoughts stopped once I reached the entrance.\n\nThe front entrance was in ruins. The ceiling had been torn down with rubble blocking the entrance entirely. There was no way to access it, and even if you could squeeze through you would risk the whole mess collapsing on you. And then there was the body. My teacher was lying on the floor. His body was mangled to the point you could barely recognize him. His face was practically torn off. His blood and entrails spread across the floor and walls. The smell hit the hardest, it was the most disgusting thing I had ever smelled in my entire life. I stood there for a while, not knowing what to do. How did this happen? Who had done this?\u00a0\n\nThen I heard the stomping.\n\nI began to run back to the classroom as the stomping behind me only got louder. I didn\u2019t know if it was behind me or not but I didn\u2019t want to find out. Whatever was there let out an unholy noise. It sounded like it was screeching while inhaling. The noise pierced my skull as I continued to run in horror. I reached the detention classroom and ran inside, closing the door behind me.\n\nThe room was empty, Laura was nowhere to be seen. Whatever got the teacher must have gotten her too. But what was it? The thumps got louder and louder with the screeching continuing at random intervals. Suddenly the shadow of the creature passed by the window of the classroom. I couldn\u2019t see much of it but I knew one thing for sure. It wasn\u2019t human.\u00a0\n\nI waited for what seemed like an eternity until I felt as though the monster was gone. I opened the door slowly and peered out. The hallway was no longer lit up, the lights were completely smashed, all I could make out was the outlines of the classroom doors and lockers. I took a deep breath and stepped out trying to be as silent as possible. My best move was to get to the office, the controls for the magnetic locks were in there and so was my phone. I could call for help and unlock the magnetic doors letting me leave. Plus the office faculty may still be in there and could be oblivious to the monster roaming around. The least I could do is try to warn them.\n\nI started to make my way through the hallway trying not to make a sound. I was on the first floor and I knew the office was on the second. I just had to make it up the stairs without running into that THING again. I made my way through the halls quietly and paranoid. I had never felt so much fear in my entire life, each second felt hours long and I knew I could easily be found at any moment.\u00a0\n\nI felt alone, everyone I trusted wasn\u2019t with me anymore. All my friends were busy with their own lives, so I was left to face the darkness alone. I felt like I had no one by my side. No one to trust. No one to lean on. I was all on my own. But yet they all paid attention to Bethany. They all talked to Bethany, they all hung out with Bethany. Why were my friends there for her? Why weren\u2019t they there for me?\n\n\u00a0I suddenly snapped out of my trance. What were those feelings? Why am I thinking about Bethany and my friends right now? They have nothing to do with this. I felt alone at the moment as I was locked in a school with a monster, but that was something different. That was a memory. That\u2019s how I felt. What had I done? Before I could remember anything else, I saw it.\n\nIt was staring in front of me at the other end of the hall. It was at least 3 times my height. It had a large skull-like face. Its arms were long and its hands were huge, each with incredibly long and skinny fingers. Its legs were large as well, with backward knees and large deformed feet. His entire body was malnourished with his skin-tight around his bones. You could see its rib cage and you could see it breathing. Its eyes and mouths were hollow, with only a faint red light in its eyes.\u00a0\n\nWe stared at each other for what seemed like hours. Both equally fascinated in the other. It then started to raise its hand. It slowly extended its arm and finger, pointing at me with no expression on its face. Then it let out a screech. And then it started to move.\n\nI ran in the opposite direction of the hallway, trying to reach the other staircase\n\nBehind me, I could hear the creature screeching and stomping forward. I turned around at one point to see it. Its hands were in front of it like a T Rex, and it was stomping forward at incredible speed. Adrenaline rushed through my body as I pushed myself to reach the staircase. I ran up the stairs as the creature continued to howl behind me. I reached the second floor with the office in reach. Suddenly a hand grabbed me and pulled me into a classroom.\n\nI tried to scream but a hand covered my mouth. It was Laura. She motioned me to be quiet by putting her finger on her lip. Outside we heard the monster pass, still letting out its horrific screeches. Once the noises had faded. Laura removed her hand from my mouth and began to talk.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I even saved you after what you did.\u201d Said Laura. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d. I responded. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to Bethany, I didn\u2019t hurt her.\u201d. Laura turned to me with an angry look in her eyes. \u201cFunny you should say that.\u201d She said intensely, \u201cbecause I never mentioned Bethany.\u201d. My eyes widened as I realized my slip up. \u201cYou know what you did.\u201d Said Laura. \u201cYou just don\u2019t want to remember.\u201d.\u00a0\n\nWith that, something snapped within me \u201cSHUT UP!\u201d I screamed as I knocked Laura to the ground. She stood up and punched me in the jaw, knocking me to the floor. \u201cADMIT TO WHAT YOU DID!\u201d She screamed, hitting me again as I lay on the floor. \u201cADMIT IT!\u201d. \u201cYOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID ADMIT IT!\u201d\u00a0\n\nSuddenly the hand of the creature burst through the classroom door. Both of us jumped back in fear. The creature howled its horrific screech as it clawed its way through the door and into the classroom. It stood tall still letting out its hollow screech. Laura was quick to act, picking up a nearby textbook and charging at the monster. She swung the textbook at the creature and hit it square in the jaw. The creature stumbled back and crashed into the wall letting out a screech of pain.\u00a0\n\nLaura ran back to me and grabbed my arm pulling me up. Just as we were about to leave the classroom, however, the creature's hand-launched forward and grabbed Laura. She screamed in fear as the creature tried to pull her way. I grabbed on to Laura\u2019s arm refusing to let her go. The creature however was stronger and grabbed Laura with its other hand. With Laura screaming in fear and pain I watched as her arm slowly began to tear, before coming off completely in my hands. The blood poured out of what was once her arm, drenching the classroom in the dark red liquid.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I watched in horror as the creature lifted Laura into the air, grabbing Laura's head with one hand and her feet with the other. Then as Laura screamed in pain and absolute terror, I watched as the creature began to pull. I could hear the bones cracking, I could hear the skin ripping, all while Laura screams in agony. Finally the tension gave in and the creature with a loud howl ripped Laura in half. Her intestines sprawled out as blood and entrails began to cover the floor. Her upper half laid lifeless in the creature\u2019s hands, her expression still locked in a terrified scream. The creature, body in hand, let out a terrifying screech and as I began to run out of the classroom and towards the office.\n\nI reached the office with the monster still screeching in the distance. I opened the door to find what I expected. The faculty were all mangled, with blood coating the walls. I ran behind the desk and first unlocked the magnetic doors. I then opened up the desk and grabbed my phone. I called 911 as I could hear the screeching getting louder. After what felt like an eternity the line picked up. \u201cHello 911 what\u2019s your emergency?\u201d \u201cHello!\u201d I yelled. \u201cI need help, there\u2019s a-.''\n\nThe monster\u2019s hands burst through the ceiling above me, causing me to drop my phone as I scream in terror. I ran out of the room without even thinking. I could worry about the police later, the doors were unlocked. I had to leave. I ran through the hallway as the monster attempted to claw its way through the ceiling in the office. I was going to make it. I was going to make it. And then I saw her locker.\n\nBethany. Bethany\u2019s locker. I tried to avoid looking at it, but I couldn\u2019t. What Laura said rang through my head. \u201cYou know what you did, you just don\u2019t want to remember.\u201d. I tried to push the memory away. This wasn\u2019t the time. This wasn\u2019t the place. I looked at the locker again as I heard the monster screaming in the distance. I don\u2019t care anymore. I don\u2019t care if it hurts. I don\u2019t care if I die. I don\u2019t want to forget anymore. I want to remember.\n\nI remember the morning. I remember feeling alone. All of my friends were busy with their own lives, leaving me to face my darkness alone. I was sad, I was alone, I was scared. And then I saw her. Bethany. Talking with my friends as always. I remember the jealousy. Why did they only care about her, why were they always there for her, why were they never there for me.\u00a0\n\nI remember the rage, I remember the darkness and fear inside me taking over. I remember the happiness on her face when she saw me. I remember when that happiness turned into fear. I remember the blood as I smashed her head against the locker repeatedly. I remember the fear on my friend's face. I remember them trying to hold me back as I stomped her head in with my feet. I remember her barely breathing. I remember the ambulance taking her away. I remember being placed in the detention room until the police and faculty could figure out what to do. I remember the fear of losing my friends to her. I remember the jealousy of not being happy like her. I remember my hatred for her. I hated her. I hurt her. I almost killed her.\n\nWith that memory, I stopped where I stood. I fell to my knees in tears. What had I done? I had let my jealousy, my fear of loneliness take over, and where had that gotten me? I was all alone now. No friends. No future. No hope. I could hear the monster behind me now but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t deserve to live for what I\u2019ve done. I deserve to die.\n\nThe monster grabbed my shoulders and turned me around as it lifted me up. I stared at his hollow red eyes as tears flowed down my face. I\u2019m sorry Bethany. I\u2019m sorry everyone. I deserve this. The monster\u2019s eyes began to glow a brilliant orange. His mouth soon followed, filling with that bright brilliant light as he let out his howl. I stared at the lights, mesmerized by their brilliance. Then it went black.\n\nI woke up in a room with my hands tied to a hook on the ceiling. It seemed to be a boiler room. If it was the boiler room of the school or some other building I did not know. The room was small, only containing a boiler and a drain on the floor. The drain was stuffed with what looked like flesh and feces. The walls around me are old and disgusting. The wallpaper peels in multiple areas. The room smelled horrible, the smell coming from the feces and rotting flesh in the drain. I looked around and saw other hooks with rotting bodies with their hands tied just like me. Suddenly in a corner, I saw it. The creature. It noticed me and slowly made its way over. I tried to move as it approached but it was no use.\n\nThe creature walked over to me and stood in front of me. I could feel its breath hitting my face. I wasn\u2019t scared to die, I wanted to die, why hadn\u2019t it killed me? Finally, I found the courage to speak. \u201cWHAT DO YOU WANT?!\u201d. The creature stared at me before extending its hand and caressing my face with its long fingers. Then it spoke, and its answer was more terrifying than anything I could have imagined. \u201cFriends\u201d.",
        "Chapter 4. The Desert.\n\n\nDom ordered a round of beer mostly to silence the hush that fell around the room. The music began again haltingly but it found its rhythm again. But the atmosphere had changed. Avery felt alone. But very much in the company of well trained and orderly merry-makers. Pedro had the faintest fold of a smile on the edges of his cheeks and on the upturn of his lips. His eyes shone with something other than beer. And after some glimmers of growing success Pedro played vehemently into again netting up losses.\n\n\n\u201cPay up you little brownie!\u201d Castor sneered drunkedly and threw his cards in Pedro\u2019s direction. Pedro almost laughed in reply. Avery couldn\u2019t help but chuckle with him. He was shaking with happiness. But there was also something threatening in Castor\u2019s tone that Avery did not like.\n\n\nNow, referencing Pedro\u2019s skin, Avery found himself looking at him differently for the first time. Had Pedro always been in the sun? Why were none of his other uncles so well painted? Had he thought Pedro always dirty from working more than any other soul in town? If only to pay off his gambling debts? Avery\u2019s mind began to buzz in different sort of way with deep beer stained questions, but the questions had always been there begging for an answer. Beer only made him whine intenaly for the answer that no one at the table was talking about. It was almost more than he could handle, but he had learned to not open his mouth in front of his Uncle\u2019s or he would be scolded for disrespect. Meanwhile Uncle Tom, Dom and Castor smoked the room out with the cigars Pedro had rolled. It was thick enough that Avery\u2019s eyes stung, but he had nothing better\n\n\nFor Avery the games could have ended much sooner. But the moon was high by the time they, one by one, tottered off. Avery, without his usual accomplice, found himself walking home beside his best friend\u2019s father down the narrow dusty roads to the opposite end of town from his own.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHow much you owe?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA dollar to Dom. And a day\u2019s work for Castor.\u201d said Pedro as he fumbled in his pockets he tapped a pocket and seemed to find what he was looking for.\n\n\n\u201cThey were pretty drunk Uncle Pedro.\u201d\n\n\nPedro chuckled then laughed heartily, \u201cSometimes they are so drunk. They don\u2019t even remember the next day.\u201d\n\nThe two laughed together as they went. The questions that formed in Avery's mind earlier came back like a moth to its candlelight perch as Pedro lit the last of his three rationed cigars for the day. The first he smoked after breakfast as he prepared to begin work in the field. The second he smoked as he walked to the Goose. The third was for his walk home. Any superfluous smoking was at the donation of friends.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat was Aunt Josie running from?\u201d Pedro didn\u2019t look at him but drew deeply and expelled a cloud that stained the night with true black But the edges of the smoke caught the silver linings of the moon.\n\n\n\u201cThere are things in this world, Son.\u201d he shook his drunken head, \u201cWe all need to run from.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUncle Pedro that ain\u2019t an answer.\u201d\n\n\nPedro was drunker than usual and he continued, \u201cWhen you find you have to run. You will know it. But will you run fast enough? Can you run long enough? How will you know? And when the judge comes, how will you know it\u2019s going to be good for you? Slow or quick? Eh? No one knows. If the judge says 'hang him!' Who says to the hangman 'let him go'? Who lets you go? When everyone is in the business of keeping? Everybody keeps. That's the root of it.\u201d\n\n\nAvery waited for the thought to fade in the desert of silence but found it only seemed to roll into the crunch of gravel under their feet.\n\n\n\u201cWhat did she run from?\u201d Avery pried hoping the alcohol held the door open. Pedro watched the ground they walked on for a breath or so silently.\n\n\n\u201cI saved her.\u201d Pedro nodded his head to himself but his voice sounded like someone found a dead hatchling bird. \u201cShe ran from here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFrom what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe ran for herself. No future here. She ran to\u2026\u201d but here Pedro shook his head.\n\n\n\u201cIs it too much to explai -\u201d Avery began to say but Pedro cut him off.\n\n\n\u201cShe got in trouble here. Leaving made it worse. So I stopped it from happening. That\u2019s how they let me be one of them here.\u201d the drunk tripped on a rock but somehow kept his balance \u201cI look after Josie. That was the price.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThis answer silenced Avery. Pedro intoned his existence here as much a punishment as it was his delight. There was not a note of bitterness in his voice. These things all said clearly that all was not as it seemed. Not for the Delrios and not for Keythos. And that meant not for Avery either. The thought of conspiracy was not yet forming. He had never thought of it before. The elders were the elders because he had always been told that they handled the important decisions. What was so important that Aunt Josie stay here?\n\n\nThey came to the gate of Pedro\u2019s house. And Pedro put the remainder of his cigar in the boy\u2019s hand. And raised his finger to his lips with the other on the lad\u2019s shoulder as if something more was to be said. Avery\u2019s heart soared. First, to be given tobacco by the closest he had ever had to a father, marking him as he thought, as a man. And second the great welling of a secret seemed to drum like a tide against Pedro\u2019s pursed lips. But as the man nearly burst he turned away. His strength to hold in had won out and waving good night Avery watched him walk up the porch steps.\u00a0\n\n\nThe moment his step reached the top a woman\u2019s voice rang out from inside:\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re done losing at the Goose again?\u201d\n\n\nAvery saw the shadow of Pedro shrug at the door before he squared himself and shuffled through the dark frame. Josie\u2019s voice said something indistinct. Then it grew sharper and heavy with contempt.\n\n\n\u201cYour drunk.\u201d She spat louder than Pedro needed to hear. For Avery heard it clearly from the lane where he was still drawing on the remains of Pedro\u2019s cigar. Pedro did not reply.\n\n\n\u201cYou lost more money I know that. Where\u2019s Malcolm?\u201d A low mumble of a voice replied followed by some clearing of his voice. Which not a few minutes before was so free of inhibition that he was adding smoke to it.\n\n\n\u201cYou let my only son walk right out the Goose, under your supervision, in the middle of the night with a girl.\u201d Josie\u2019s voice postured like a colonel dressing down a sargent. \u201cWhat slut is he doing God knows what with -and with your permission?\u201d\n\n\nHe cleared his throat again.\n\n\n\u201cDom\u2019s girl?\u201d she shrieked, but then paused and calmly but with every tongue of flame that blame could thrust given her voice she pushed into her words, \u201cAnd I bet you didn\u2019t say a word. You spineless limp cactus of a man.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDom no say - didn\u2019t say- nothing neither.\u201d Pedro managed an effort to defend himself. But it was a weak argument. Maybe he intended it to be weak. Because it seemed to be exactly what Josie wanted.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s no excuse! You weak. Pathetic. Moraless man.\" She very likely would have lit her own fuse, bitterness came to her voice like a thousand well honed knives \"God must have given up on you at birth. That\u2019s why you\u2019re cursed to work your whole life through and never keep a dollar to save your life.\u201d\n\n\nPedro now said nothing in reply. And from the silence from the little abode Avery thought the disagreement and flair of temper was over. In reality, Pedro, having known this way of life for some years now had caught himself in a nasty web of argument. Where by defending himself he knew he was only inviting more abuse. But having already done it. He was hesitating to either say anything at all or find some reason outside himself for explaining why the world was round or flat, but he couldn\u2019t seem to decide which crowd he was speaking to at that second. So he delayed. And this hesitation backed by his inclination to wait out the storm was signaled far too strongly and Josie sensed it immediately.\n\n\nThis time her voice issued out calm and sad, but this was just the blade for the poison: \u201cGod made you this way, I suppose, so I must accept your filthy ways and sin as the gift God gave to support me through this life of misery he\u2019s blessed us with.\u201d\n\n\nPedro sighed. Or exhaled from having held his breath.\n\n\n\u201cOh, are you relieved?\u201d Josie\u2019s temper, baited itself, but loved the excuse of another\u2019s weakness to prove it right, \u201cWhy? Why are you relieved?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\u201cDo you think my acceptance of your trash makes me feel any better?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIf Josie had been a drinker Avery could have have blamed liquor. He knew Josie had a temper, but generally she hid it in smiles and service, and only sometimes did it emerge occasionally as stinginess.\u00a0\n\n\nThe wife of Pedro went on, her voice clamoring incredulous: \u201cDo you ever care to think how I feel about these decisions you get to make on your own with my son? About anything? I have lost everything to you. I never thought you would be the cause of me losing my son. I know you never loved me. I know you had to.\u201d She began to sob in her anger, but her voice indicated her own wounded nobility. Pedro sat motionless. Avery\u2019s eyes drooped with the effect of a beer and a long day, He would have nodded off had the severity of Josie\u2019s voice not continued after a long dramatic pause.\n\n\n\u201cYou never did anything I want.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cYOU never cared about my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just take and take and take. I have nothing to give you anymore. Now that my son is out in the world and sowing his wild oats\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c- and making decisions that he can\u2019t take back.\u201d Her voice quickened and enraged in tempo, \u201cI don\u2019t even want anything from you anymore. I haven\u2019t in all the years I\u2019ve known you. But you\u2019ve raised my son to be just like you. I bet you're proud. I bet you are proud he\u2019s just like you. That he\u2019s never going to get out of this desert waste of a town, racking up debt and obligation to every stinking person he knows as family. And that is Your doing. YOU never think about how I feel.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShe inhaled sharply, the cat had found its prey and the claws went for blood \u201cYOU never think about my reputation to a husband who is everyone\u2019s worthless tool: who everyone is laughing up their sleeves at every time you can\u2019t figure out a card game. YOU never think about me. I am married to the doormat of Keythos: But I REFUSE to be a doormat for any of them! Not Dom! Not TOM! AND NOT YOU!\u201d\n\n\nA door slammed and something rolled off the clay tile roof. Pedro paused a long time in silence by himself. Then without any warning he blew out the lantern and sat back in his chair and began to gently snore.\u00a0\n\n\nThe mind of the meek kept to itself; but the mind of anger lets all show. But who is really stronger? The one who could win and puts up no defense? Or the one screaming under the pressure that life will inevitably bring?\n\n\nAvery shook himself awake to a silence that was better than the bad dream of reality that had just unfolded in front of him. But he was not in his bed. He was still standing in the lane with cold ash draped across his knuckles. He regarded the fireless tobaco regretfull that he had not taken full advantage. So he tossed the cigar aside and set out for home. The question that followed him were the predictable one\u2019s.\n\n\nDid Aunt Josie love Pedro? Did she ever? And this immediately led to: Do all married people get like this? Avery did not know. How could know? -being a decade and a half old? He had never been married and his own mother had raised him having never had his father there to speak to much less fight with.\n\n\nThe title of father spoken by our children is of the oddest and oldest. What it means is: our mother\u2019s lover who began ourselves in her. But even without love we are begun. Even without the intent to have an inheritor of attributes and possessions; we are all begat. Where the love falls is only clear by the man who begats.\u00a0\n\n\nAvery, having never met his father, having never had a lover, Avery thought of none of these things. To him, his father was assumed to have loved his mother and had only chosen her in the effort of obtaining the gem that was himself. But had, despite all excitement, had died tragically before they were able to meet.\n\n\nSo, to Avery, to see his best image of father he knew berated and chastised by the one who held the title of his wife; left him feeling twisted and wrong. As if he had witnessed a man walk up the wall and across the ceiling in the middle of the night. The law of love had been crossed, and the law of marriage was supposed to hold that up: but it did not. It had not. So was all marriage open to this contrivance of anti-love? Was it so simple that the wind of circumstance blow all life until, as a bare canyon, it\u2019s only life is the shrill whistle from the flute of the dead?\n\n\nAvery neared home, realizing now that his body ached. That all this time he had been oblivious, but in the first time of being alone he began to feel his limbs asking for rest. It began to mean more that his body ached and he looked forward to his bed.\n\n\nAnd there on the porch waiting in the flicker of lantern light was his mother sitting up with her reading and patiently awaiting her son\u2019s return. She embraced him gently and quietly sent him to bed. And seeing that, shortly after laying the boy down, he was fast asleep; she smiled to herself.\n\n\nThe wide brown eyes of Elise spoke in a deep well of kindness. But with a kind of surrender to life. An ease by existence that somehow the worst of life was over and the remainder of mediocre pains that could come were nothing more than light conversation. And the joys of what remained? That is what her face found; in her tea, in her reading, in the choosing of meals for her and her son, in the matching of what to wear or the tactile feel of a particular weave of linen. But most of all she had seen it in the face of her husband. Who had been gone these long years. So naturally the next best thing was the face of her own son.\n\n\nShe was thin, probably too thin to be healthy. Her form was draped in fine clothes, and in a fine house but her face wore deep lines across her sorrowful cheeks. She was by no means a beauty. As her beauty was not in her skin or complexion, which was left scarred by pox, or in long hair, for she had gotten lice more than once and had cut it off. But the beauty was in her eyes lighting up. And somewhere in the recesses of her childhood she had made the connection to the joy in others and the joy that led from her heart and out her eyes. This would make man and woman swoon of heart for her. Because they seemed to feel what her eyes would emit.\n\n\nBut if one was not looking to her eyes than you would see a frail widow, of middling money, who looked sad and wore clothes that seemed large enough to sail her little frame away over the desert. And there still her eyes would glisten as she lay down to sleep. Something clean in the way her face would touch the sheets. It was the feeling of a small death overtaking her. Not in pursuit of our terror like we dream our ending pursues us, but to the drift and murmur and mercy of the eternal soaking away of our pains like a rush of perfect water.",
        "Chapter 3. The Goose and Ganders.\n\n\nThe village of Keythos was a small and insignificant collection of people. Nestled into an uncomfortable geographic oddity. Being below snow capped mountains the nights could get very cold. But also being on the southern edge of a mountain range where the persistent trade winds blew most all precipitation North and Westward. And somehow, not that far South of Keythos, were lush grasslands full of wild game. And yet somehow people had settled in Keythos and had a proud tradition in desert living. Provided for, in good measure, by imported goods and foods, despite the high population of farmers to any other profession.\n\n\nMost members of this society descended, by claim, accident or infidelity: from two families who had laid claim to the land going back at least three generations. Those landholders held this place as their own as if they had always been there, and that before them there had been no people, at least no one that anyone spoke of. Which, I can say, no one wondered at the arrowheads laying in the dirt and gave a second thought on whose hands it was that lifted the obsidian rock and threw it down to find the right piece to turn to use. But somehow in the passing of land from those people to these present ones came the curse of dry land that they held as their provincial pride and heritage. The shadow ghost of the old inhabitant did not rejoice either in the loss of the land or the treatment of it. For the understanding of it had passed away with their living on it. So the cactus grew. And the\u00a0 grasses died.\n\n\nTo this town few came - none stayed. Travelers felt the eye brand of stranger upon them; even those of amiable business connections desired no extra time or expense on it or its inhabitants. Treatment whether civil traveler, vagrant or criminal, most folk from the outside were lumped altogether in the latter categories.\u00a0\n\n\nThis idea of stranger and vague guiltiness made way to legitimize their inflation of prices, their dirty looks at them, increasing their natural desire to spit in public; and, on the whole, inspired a collective absorbed together in comraderie of uncreative jokes and malicious heckling. Indeed I could have written \u2018un-Christian like behavior\u2019 but then you would have read that to mean whatever you wanted. But like children of the religion, they read the old testament with the perspective that they were \u2018the chosen\u2019 and everyone outside could not be. If only by segregation of dress and mannerism. Nevermind that they did not have a clear idea of what a Jew really was because who really believes in slingshots and giants? Particularly when you have carte blanche from Deity and gunpowder? Ignorance and Religion take long walks on the corpses of the hopes and dreams that only Love and Understanding caretake. But if love is meant by \u201cspare not the rod\u201d. Then beatings is what you give your child. If you know shepherding, however, the rod is a tool for guiding the ignorant beast, gently through perilous country, not at all a scourge to be feared. But a tool of guidance that was there to be trusted.\n\n\nThere were four leaders, chiefs the locals had the gall to call them, who represented and decided all things public. They were all cousins who shared a passion for making quick decisions for the feeling of justice. But something grew overtime: the growing feeling of power in the fear of the populace at each sacrifice of Able that was made with the gallow\u2019s dance. Most outsiders watched their own behavior carefully and uprightly and dared no dissent as they passed through. For fear of the local rush to justice. And pre-justice was a preweighed scale out of most human behavior. The locals knew how to contain a running man very efficiently. Court proceedings were usually done the following day after capture. Sentencing was relished and public and perhaps a little way in part due to hangover. Hanging was the popular spectacle; drinking heavily to gloat was the preamble to justice. So it is that the unimportant overreach in their attempt to matter. But matter to what? To whom? The people did not know because they were little different than their chiefs. Maybe not naturally, but it was safer to blend in.\n\n\nFor the townsfolk it seemed, on the whole, safe. For the corpse that was left to hang was never a familiar face, no one they knew or loved. He had come from somewhere, but to them he had come from nowhere but hell itself. To be a criminal was the result of crime. Was not Justice and the Rope invented to correct wrongdoing for this very purpose?\n\n\nAnd yet the dead terrified face framed in hemp winding spoke of the error by simply having a face. The dead face of justice was only the end of the story for that face; rendered unable to tell the story of his own passage. And so they grew to fear death of all kinds because the story would never be heard. Neither by their neighbor or by their god. Death, you see, is the living fear of silence; given over to us in our nightmares of being unable to cry out. To dare fate we thrive. By facing near death: we conquer it.\u00a0\n\n\nBut Death is no more conquerable than the womb that brought us here. And silence to some is\u00a0 the release from the chaos that cannot be opposed. Is it irony that we are released from a place of peace and sent into chaos only to sway under the urgent need to keep all the chaos under grips; when death offers us release? But what good is release? If you never felt the value of good in struggle? This is why God is no robot against our displeasure. The struggle is part of the gift. And release\u2026 well. We all might pine for it every now and again, but in doing so we lose focus on the little pleasures of small accomplishments of no material consequence. What else can we call \u2018happiness\u2019 other than this? No. Not that. You are thinking of Joy. And that has no reason.\n\n\nThe Goose, mentioned in the first few chapters of this book, was the liveliest place in town. It was a building erected over a natural cave. It had stood there as the very first of the buildings in Keythos. In fact the trees that had once spread around the plateau had clustered tall and thick over the cave entrance. Many of them had been used to build the now worn and dusty structure. At the bottom of the cave was a deep well. No one knew who dug it. They assumed it had been their ancestor. But it was those same hands who dug it that had made the potshards and arrowheads they cast aside with disdain. What good, after all, could a stranger have to give when it was only to be coerced or cheated? And once cheated: why remember it?\n\n\nThe Goose having both a cooled area out of the sun and access to pure water. Which I have to say that particular water was some of the purest and nourishing water I have ever tasted. In daytime it proved itself as a shared kitchen amongst the women in town. They baked bread together, and brewed the beer, and boiled water for the miles of laundry.\u00a0\n\n\nAs the work in the fields would end the men would come here as the women went home to finish their homes in readying their families for the onslaught of another day. The men gathered to drink and talk. To play games and find a relief and commiseration from the heat and toil of the day. The women could listen but few understood the stresses as another man bent to the same task and similar sufferings.\n\n\nThe Goose came to be when one of the founders wive\u2019s hips were described by the sway of a walking goose (The geese that once used to stop here on its seasonal circuit but it had been a generation since any had flown by. Most never gave it a thought but others remembered fondly the fall harvest eating their mothers could render.) The thought struck a chord with the men as this pleasant thought was a mirthful celebration of something they all saw. And soon it lived on in the sway of all hips that swayed. Of which, presently, in the Goose at night, there were none: for propriety's sake. The brotherhood of men made an indwelling and at night women were not generally allowed.\n\n\nMal and Avery came to The Goose and went in the front swinging vest shaped doors and then down the heavy rough timber staircase the handrails and posts worn smooth from the passing of many hands. The cool rush of stale subterranean air greeted them and the sweat began to escape off their backs. The familiar voices of cousins, fathers and uncles and brothers echoed off the limestone cavern walls in open invitation.\u00a0\n\n\nCousin Eneas played a classical guitar in one corner while the youngest of them pallidly sang a song he loved. The boy could not have understood the words. But the words were so sonorus that he had clearly fallen in love with the sounds themselves. He sang well for a shaky little boy that was trying hard to be a young man. But he could not have been more childish for the trying. And in this failing he could not have been more beautiful to hear sing. It was a joy he could not have comprehended the sad words of the ballad that he dared quote. But when the chorus came the room would join in. And the noise so strong that neither was any one there not their brother nor a single word intelligible.\n\n\nThe song would end and another inspired heart would call out the name of another tune and he would stand up and join the musician to perform.\n\n\nAvery and Mal found the busiest table and drew up their chairs slightly behind to not disturb a tense game of hearts.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPedro! What are your rascals up to. eh?\u201d Uncle Castor spied the dust on their shoulders.\n\n\nThe dark-skinned face of Pedro turned and looked them over without batting an eye and then looked lazily at Uncle Castor.\n\n\n\u201cThey sure are late in getting here. Don\u2019t you wonder what held them up?\u201d Castor re-enforced his issue.\n\n\nPedro\u2019s beard seemed to smile but he made no grimace of any emotion at this observation.\n\n\n\u201cWorking, my boys are always working.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot the way my cornfields are looking. You promised to walk \u2018em last week. How come it ain\u2019t done yet?\u201d\n\n\nPedro knew they had been off all afternoon causing whatever trouble they wished. But that was of no real concern to Pedro. And if it had caused Castor any perturbation he would have considered it all the better. His boys were his very heart and he was proud of their friendship and neverminded the petty trouble the managed to cause. And anytime he could, even at the expense of negligence or obligation, he would assist them in any way. They were his boys by any reckoning about the town. Malcolm by his wife Josie; and Avery was taken in as family having never known his own father.\u00a0\n\n\nThe boys gathered behind Pedro and watched the game of cards unfold. Pedro never seemed to catch the jist of the game or a knack for how the cards played out. His preternatural knack was, sadly, a magnetic pole of misfortune. He would, time and time again, lay out a card triumphantly. Only to be outdone by someone else\u2019s improbably good cards. The loss was that it was always gambling; which meant Pedro would play by any means. If money he had he gambled it away; if for the next round of beer: he bought it. Sometimes it was for the few valuable things he had on his farm, and he would lose it. Sometimes, when there was nothing else, he would bet a day\u2019s labor.\n\n\nSo it was that Pedro knew every man\u2019s family, every man\u2019s farm, every man\u2019s needs and wants and preference and worked continuously to provide just enough for himself and for general wealth and welfare of the town, not as any sort of mayor, but rather as each and every man\u2019s temporary slave.\n\n\n\u201cShuffle again Pedro!\u201d they\u2019d say if his luck ever seemed to swing. And sure enough, Pedro would smile his shy nervous smile and shuffle and any winnings thereafter were rarely retained by the game. And if so the good was rarely given, and never demanded.\n\n\nIn their hearts game it became apparent very early that he was again trying to shoot the moon. This they laughed and foiled and then the stories would start.\n\n\n\u201cPedro, you remember when you was first here\u2026 and you did this thing\u2026\u201d They would imitate his nervous tick of tugging on his ear which leaned his head to one side. And there was this mild stuttering speech that would leave them laughing and gasping for air; the heaving of their bellies threatened at least half the buttons on their shirts.\n\n\nPedro would only shrug. Sometimes he would smile if the jest was cleverly done.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like he didn\u2019t know it was normal\u2026\u201d They would chortle among themselves at his ignorance of their custom and society. If the were wearing dinner jackets you might have thought them elite. But these beggars looked every bit worse off than Pedro. Particularly when Pedro still had most of his teeth and a good many of them had nothing left but slivers and nubs. They had, of course, no intention of ever letting him, or anyone, ever forget his place among them. But Pedro played along very well that some could not help but feel it was not needed to point it out as Pedro would laugh with them. It infuriated some that he could never seem to be degraded to his face. Because anyone dumb enough to insult him directly both looked stupid and out of temper and also risked finding out what the \u2018outsider\u2019 was actually capable of. Of which, by the merit of his work, they respected his deeds well enough. But also by which they feared his rise to equal compliance of his self worth and his work ethic. Simply by laughing it seemed he never truly accepted the ridicule. So the few people who had little love for Senor Delrio could only get their justice in by ragging him amongst others who also felt as they did.\n\n\nAfter stories had settled and the cool had absolved the scorch from their bodies but the beer had awakened their inner need to continue a mirth that would escape them should they simply go to bed. But also the need for more beer because the need for mirth was itself there to cover the question that was nagging them somewhere between their fear and their purpose. So liquor was opened and poker played. This was the set stage - in exemplar ad infinitum - that the boys had found their elders at their regular vices.\n\n\n\u201cNow -\u201d started old Tom, who was more like the town mute, but when had enough to float his eyeballs, which indeed, this particular evening, of the moon did they shine; did he also find his tongue. Though he stuttered worse than Pedro ever did. But no one seemed to mock him. Rather they seemed scared of what the man might say. Belching and pausing all the way- Listen! The man speaks:\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThere was that one time.\u201d his voice broke out. The Goose went silent and every soul turned to listen. Tom raised his finger in the air with verification. \u201cThat -\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh shut it Tom.\u201d said his brother Dom sullenly, \u201cNot that story again.\u201d\n\nDom lit a fresh cigar eyeing the other over the brightening cherry. Tom moon-eyed and near drowning in his own wits seemed to not hear.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhen Josie runned off\u2026 tuh- to-\u201d old Tom paused again lost and grasping. But Dom didn\u2019t stop him, \u201ct-to whare...she ran t-to. Pedro. He found her out.\u201d Tom smiled wide his head nodding in earnest looking kindly at Pedro \u201cHe brought her home.\u201d\n\n\nThe Goose stayed quiet. But Tom found no other words.\n\n\n\u201cThen he married her!\u201d shouted Dom raising a glass and a cheer broke out. And the short stuttering story ended. But its short intent was more poignant than even old Tom would ever know.\n\n\n\u201cHad a kid mighty quick too.\u201d Castor grinned. Pedro shrugged again with his smile. It was not uncommon for young married folk to have children nine months after a quick ceremony. And not every pregnancy goes that long either.\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t feel no shame do ya.\u201d grunted Dom over the top of his glass of beer, a half smile on his face.\n\n\n\u201cI am as proud of Malcolm as everyone here is. I couldn\u2019t not love the boy.\u201d Pedro said in perfect assurance. Maybe it was the liquor\u2019s work but its effect seemed rehearsed. But no one caught that nuance but the author.\n\n\nAvery had heard the story before, many times, and so had Malcolm. But neither had seen a story so full of mystery that neither could form a question or quite how or what there was to ask about. Malcolm had just opened his mouth to ask, when a form appeared on the stair. It was the thin form of the dark haired girl descending silently on bare feet. Her blue eyes open wide in the lantern light peering through the gloom of rough men searching for who she came for. Malcolm immediately saw the orange flag of her slightly ragging orange dress that expressed a tribute to her bare and tan shoulders.\u00a0\n\n\nAll at once the eyes found the eyes. Hers widened in beckoning. Mal stood in obedience and made for her and the stairs. It only took a second for someone to catch on as to what was happening. The men began to shout in protest that unified into:\n\n\u201cGoose. Goose. Goose.\u201d\n\nBut when the boy did not turn in shame or embarrassment but rather bodily disappeared up the stair: they stopped. Hearing the ring in the walls of their own voices.\n\nDom looked at Pedro.\n\nAnd Pedro looked back at Dom.\n\nAnd the game went on.",
        "Chapter 1. That Ruffian Malcolm.\n\n\nMalcom Delrio was what they called him. His friends called him Mal. And being a man, a lad really, who was a prudent and good fellow. His father loved him; teaching him all the ways of his life of labor. His mother smiled upon him: approving of his every gesture as a victor\u2019s triumph. Their neighbors hailed him in the street for no other reason than the joy his simple love lit something new in their own hearts.\n\n\nWhen the old men sang he would lustily sing along. The aged eyes would light in memory, a fire of hope in the past. When a man needed help he would lend his back and wit until the burden was bearable. With his friends, for he had many, but with those he held dear he would go out and do daring as all young men do.\n\n\nIn the evening he would sit at the gambling tables with his father and his father\u2019s friends drinking, telling stories through thick tales of tobacco smoke. Laughing at the old jokes and each turn of phrase that drinking would create a new mistake to be merry about. And yet bowing their heads in the silent defeat of hard times. But always heading home, head held high, not alone because their spirit, though sodden in beer, was full of the not-alone. And with a full spirit they went tottering home to their wives or mothers like orphans to their foster home.\n\n\nThey would stop at any neighboring hallowing to talk a moment and the women and girls would kiss the young lad. This was the way of things. A small local custom. Not different from many customs from around this world. And if there are other worlds, no doubt, the dangerous element of a body will touch the sensitive part of another in peace without drawing blood. And this is a show of vulnerablity of both participants. To show that advantage could be taken, but from here no harm shall come.\n\n\nBut where from does custom come?\u00a0\n\n\nCustom is a short cut to clarity. If by calamity, the calamity is celebrated by the survival method. No need to survive again; but to revel in survival is the sharing in a golden gratitude for having passed through it. But for this method of customary kiss? Because, I imagine, we all must survive love. And when life is slow and affection merely a custom: what then is Love?\n\n\nThe old grow old by knowing that a longing youth will often mistake affection and its caresses. By misidentifying the signs a youth can build the foundation of their life upon a mirage. Marriage can either be the ends or the means of affectionate life; both are vapors unable to hold love. And if it cannot hold love there can be nothing built here that will last or give any satisfaction. But if a touch is a vapor; reasoning is a cold ghost. To save the young the heartache we need to show their contrivance is hollow before a foundation of life collapses. Like a bank built upon self-thievery or helpless dependency; the old now invest to divert the calamity they themselves encountered. They see the hope in the eyes of every fool born and feel foolish for trying to expound an understanding that they themselves continue to ponder: can this fulfill me? But only one thing can. But that is easily spoken but not easily understood; and I dare not say it until it becomes clear.\n\n\nSo mothers would press him tightly to their bosoms and their daughters would kiss his lips. In each the boy would feel the duty to the custom. Either in the hesitation of proximity, the awkwardness of shyness, but sometimes there was a surge of pride, happiness and pleasure; a hot unexplained eagerness or a receding sweating anxiety. This was how they raised their sons; so doused in loving affection that no child would know otherwise and no grown man err in his missing the mark of love to the woman he takes to wife. But even in communal effort were the burned remains of couples shackled in public but broken and shattered at the soul.\n\n\nHis father told many stories under the star lit skies as they walked the trail home. Of other lands and other people. People who had treated him poorly. It had a ring of legend. But no other soul in Keythos had these stories. For the rest of them had always lived there.\n\n\n\u201cThis is my resting place,\u201d he would say, \u201cthese are my people. Who took me in.\u201d\n\n\nThe people of Keythos were largely farmers. They worked together they married their sons to their daughters and strangers were held at a suspicious and chaste distance.\n\n\n\u201cI was chased here by my own brothers, who were going to hang me from a tree for the buzzards to pick clean.\u201d his father had said.\n\n\n\u201cWhy would your brothers want to do that?\u201d Malcolm would ask incredulous at the idea that his father could ever be hated by anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\u201cI hurt someone once.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d his father would take a big breath but then only say: \u201cSometimes, you don\u2019t mean to; but you can\u2019t make it right afterward.\u201d\n\n\nThis answer left much hanging in untold story. But these stories often go untold despite the hanging possibility that they will one day be told. Malcolm waited for this day to come; for this is when he knew his father would see him as a man and trust him with his deepest pains as much as his greatest triumphs. We are so ready as men to share in our victories; but so abashed to open for consideration our failure and shame. But if we do not raise up our mortality in embrace of our children; how would they ever know these lessons anymore than a kiss would mean servitude instead of love? Perhaps it is only because we ourselves have never found our own way beyond it.\n\n\nIt happened one day the lad walked to town alone. It was hot and the sun shone bright and even the limestone seemed to radiate a bright yellow. The sound of his steps in the still of the desert amused him. It was afternoon. The hottest part of the day. All his work had been completed and so he stepped away, with his mother\u2019s blessing, to meet his friend.\n\n\nWhen you are walking alone time seems to pass at a different pace. It slows down if you are trying to get somewhere. And somehow if you are not minding the time time slows you down. Malcolm was somewhere in between. The heat made it very uncomfortable to travel any faster. So a calm mind was a great benefit.\n\n\nUp ahead was an outcropping of rock around which the road hid itself behind. Beyond it was a crossroads. Malcolm like to think that was where he would meet a thief or a bandit and find a real adventure. But nothing ever met him there that wasn\u2019t the same desert. But he always hoped for today would be different.\n\n\nA voice called to him from the shade of a cactus patch that spread itself over the rock for which the road did bend. A tan face peered out, catching the yellow beam of the sun on its way to the ground, its teeth gleamed in smile. Mal\u2019s feet turned up the rock following the voice of the girl until her bare feet stood upon the toes of his boots as she lifted her wet mouth to his lips and pressed her small breasts against his chest. It was tradition that they embrace and kiss but not tradition that they hold each other tighter after and kiss again. And longer. And then stare into the other\u2019s awe filled eyes.\n\n\nIt was the wind that woke them to the lost smiles on their faces. The concerns that had brought them together by chance came back to their mind.\n\n\n\u201cWhat brought you to me today?\u201d said the girl not caring what the answer was. For she only wanted his embrace.\n\n\nThe lad smiled, \u201cI was walking to meet Avery down the gulch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat you stirring up?\u201d the girl\u2019s eyes shewed the shine that all things the lad would claim would be blameless.\n\n\n\u201cBatch o\u2019 trouble.\u201d Mal figured reasonably with a cocky grin in a way that was daring her to stop him. The danger of losing him awoke the desire to use him while he was there. So she came gently close to him to feel the pull. Like a wind of its own creation the pull of the frame of his body through the fabric of her dress; lightly enough for a breeze to shake through, but not enough to break the draw of two trees falling against each other. She trembled for him, looked in his eyes and found that same look of trance that she felt, and trembling again they kissed softer and longer. The wind coursing through their storming insides grounding at the slightest nuanced touch of their lover.\n\n\n\u201cCome see me again?\u201d she called as he broke away. He glanced toward her; she let her shoulder strap fall to expose her round and tanned breast for him to see.\n\n\nO the ripe fruit of womankind! What is a breast to man that God made it such a shape and form of love? As a babe we met our mothers, the first creature to bid us hello. The only constant, in a world of terrible and terrifying unknowns, was the round warm and soft skin near her constant beating heart we taste the sugar of her sweat. Only here did we feel that we came to a world that life is made of expiring inconstants. The only hope of a love that does not give up; that truth and beauty unite in the symbol of yearning the heart by the budding full breast of plenty.\u00a0\n\nWhere we are fed.\n\nWhere we are touched.\n\nWhere we are cared for.\n\nAll in hope of being loved.\n\nOnly to slowly wake to the desert of living. Learning that love declines and we, from birth, are coerced, willing or not, to learn instead to give it.\n\n\nBut how do we give what we don\u2019t have? For there is no part of us that did not come from someone or someplace other. So we are not the material that made us. We are the inhabitants of a material we do not choose. Having forgot where we came and for what reason. Only that the breast reminds us of something good and safe. But as we age we are made to give it up. To find we only look for another.\n\n\nFor men we look to the next breast-like thing or person that treats us comfortably or pleasurably. For it rests in a sagging breast of loving works but it also rests in a youthful untouched blossom. For some we look for a cushion of truth to feed us. For some we sit in a place of self-made stability; bottle in one hand and inhaling smoke from the other. All to find that taste of promise of growth shooting to new heights. We think:\n\n\n\u201cIs there anyway to escape death?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs there anyway to stay young?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow can the aged and old know and act youthfully?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf the truth never dies how can the truth touch us?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIf the touch of love lives merely moments? How is love then constant?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs life a dichotomy of Love and Death?\u201d\n\n\nThe mysteries sing their own siren\u2019s song that brings us a question: \u201cHow can anything last forever. And if someone figured out how to live forever would they ever tell?\u201d\n\n\nBut in contemplating eternity we make up a breast-story. Something that calls us. Satisfies us. And makes everything alright though all we see is temporary and passing.\n\n\nOur heart calls:\n\n\u201cInebriate me, my love; enfold me, embrace me. Delightfully. Youthfully in your work, for me, enblossom me with your good.\u201d\n\nBut we don\u2019t know who it is calling to. And soon we forget the comfort of the breast, and apply it, in symbol, to every fleeting relief.\n\n\nFor a woman she grows an understanding that she is good. Sometimes just for the good of her symbols; sometimes in honor of her symbols. Sometimes in bitterness of knowing they are unwanted beyond their comforting symbolism. In any case she knows she either has desirable good; or is the desired person whose symbols soulfully compliment her.\u00a0\n\n\nThe giving of good is the will and heart of the person. Simply having good is not enough. For either man or woman. They both need the movement of good. She for the feeling of herself as good; and for all to contort in response a writhing clamor of the joy of her self-discovery. That wakes a new dream in a newer soul.\n\n\nBut let us nevermind, for the moment, of all the paths of falsehood that divert us from what is true. But do we dare think that if the truth is eternal; is falsehood death itself?\n\n\nThe bell of a cow moving toward the field clanged the alarm of her work and she shrugged the strap back on and sprang off.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back around sundown.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d she called.\n\n\n\u201cAt The Goose.\u201d he called after her as the wind seemed to have blown away his skin idol. He strode forward; strong and merry at heart.",
        "\n\nChapter 2. Our Brother Discontent\n\n\n\nAvery walked out of the front of his house. He dismissed the affectionate farewell of his mother with silence. Kicking up the dust as he walked. He was enjoying the cascade and haze as it caught in the sun beyond his shadow. His path led to the crossroads. That was where he meant originally to meet Malcolm. But once he consulted his watch, as he wound it, he knew that he was going to be significantly earlier than Malcolm was likely going to be done with his chores. So he crossed the field to the East. Where at the North Eastern corner the outcropping of rock stood where only the tops of cactus was visible beyond the sunbaked hulk.\n\n\nWhat was on his mind? It was, much of a mind like Malcolm\u2019s: set on adventure. Desirous for the opportunity to explore and discover. His mind was electric with the possibilities. It was going to be dangerous, that was a great lure, to be a man who survives. Not to be just a man who can survive but to be known. And for a second a nobody steers a tribe with the acclaim of his grit.\n\n\nWhy would anyone want to be known? For the same reason as anything else. To be held in esteem. To have a value that was not his own imagining. He had no great achievement in mind. But he knew he wanted to achieve something great.\u00a0\n\n\nHe could see a spotted cow edging slowly toward the corn field. So he knew his cousin was there. That was her job in the afternoons. But she was not there with her stick. So he naturally drifted further East. He did this for two reasons. First he could steer the cow away from the Delrio lowfield. Second, it would give him the perfect opportunity to surprise Malcolm from behind the corn rows when he eventually ventured down the road to their meeting spot. And so he calmly made his move.\n\n\nThen there was Malcolm. Walking down the road. He passed the corner of the field. It was too late. Avery almost tried to wave. He thought for a second that Malcolm had seen him. But only the cow took another brazen step toward the corn. Avery froze. And suddenly Malcolm went up the rock.\u00a0\n\n\nFor what? But as his eyes caught view of the girl standing pert and at an angle toward Malcolm. He realized that Malcolm had gone up to greet his cousin. That is. Avery\u2019s cousin. Malcolm was from a different Family altogether. Heteira was the settling name. But now under that umbrella were the Delrios. Avery was a Gennaedario. And the girl was Pleon.\u00a0\n\n\nAvery couldn\u2019t hear anything. And he watched as they embraced again. And Malcolm walked down the far side of the rock. Then he saw he draw herself up, to a high poise and he saw the strap fall loose. Malcolm\u2019s face spoke of the beauty that moved rocks and trees. But the view from behind the girl afforded him no view of her exposure. But the gesture told him everything. Her body held tense. She was a statue for a moment. Completely without pride but if beauty herself had seen her poise she would have been proud to not exist alone. He watched as she ran flushed with the blood of life and then dashed off to intercept her cow from getting into the neighboring cornfield.\u00a0\n\n\nHe felt something move inside him. Cold and warm. Something just happened. And it was almost as if he could not remember what his eyes had just seen. No he saw. He felt he should be upset. But he felt something he had felt many times before. But never before now so strongly. There was something very wantable. To be shown beauty. Given it. But something soured in him knowing that it was not for him.\n\n\nHe himself woke to the clang of the cow\u2019s bell. And with the thought that he must not show that he saw. He didn\u2019t know how he could acknowledge it. But then how was he to explain his standing in the middle of field? Anyone would think he was spying. Because he simply had spied them. He just hadn\u2019t intended to. To cover his tracks he ran to help.\n\n\n\u201cHey cousin,\u201d he called as he came along to help turn the cow back to its overgrazed patch. The girl turned and then paused to watch the cow go a safe distance away, her hair and dress slowly let the wind die out of them and settle down. And all the excitement, the flush of life, with a long glance at the now disappeared Malcolm, was gone. Only the lifeless desert remained, with a thin cow, patches of rough grass, and a spindly cornfield. And then there was Avery. The least important of these before the judge who was to Avery, suddenly and inexplicably, Beauty herself.\n\n\nThen, satisfied in her job being done for the moment, she walked over to embrace Avery. It was not like the embrace he had seen moments ago. He felt her willing in the formality; but there was no further desire to remain near him. That and their kiss was quick though he had dangerously left his own lips lingering; hers did not.\n\n\n\u201cYou just missed Mel.\u201d she retreated away from him, \u201csaid he was heading down gulch-way.\u201d It had never struck Malcolm before. She had always called him Mel. He had thought it silly and girlish. But now he wondered how his own name could be made sweeter on her lips.\n\n\n\u201cWas he?\u201d Avery sounded as if this was new news, and because he felt the need to leave the situation. As something near a chilling shiver of shame gaining on the finish line of his jaws, \u201cI guess I will have to catch him up.\u201d He walked past dismissed, his desire to be held winged by the missile of jealousy and that fell upon his regret of putting himself this far out in sight; and the truth of rejection was left up to his interpretation; and that he left to his emotions. In a small moment she had become the symbol of his unfair life. Only because he thought highly of the girl, and even though his friend had been so fortunate as to have her love; the bottom of the pit in his stomach said that he would rather have this best than celebrate with his friend for having it.\n\n\n\nShe represented a love he could not have, her lithe and tan form or her attention to anyone else was a timeless tribute to his deficiency of love and attention that he should and ought to have. But it did not. In this darkening of thought it seemed to either lower the hat over his face or the very light in his eyes and bent his shoulders under the sun, dim and hopeless, earthward. So beauty led to despair.\u00a0\n\n\nHe walked down to the gulch. It was not a great landmark. Other than it was marked by a bridge to even the road and keep it open when the rains fell and sparked the torrent of flooding that the solid caliche refused to allow to soak in.\n\n\nMal waved from below. Avery hesitated a step at the ridge. Looking down was no dizzying height but it was loose dirt and rock; but more it was that Malcolm seemed for a moment an enemy of everything good. Because it seemed that he would have it if Malcolm did not exist. The years of adventure and laughter, staled in memory, in an instant. He questioned his purpose in this meeting; but remembered that this thing was friendship. So he pushed his pretty cousin from his mind and sauntered down into the gulch to his friend unconscious that his hand was resting on the handle of his holstered pistol. If she did not exist in his mind he could think clearly. But now the charm of many adventures were not with him. And though Avery met Malcolm for adventure. Only Malcolm was truly there. Avery trailed along drug down by his yearning to forget the girl.\n\n\n\u201cHey Avery.\u201d said the lad cheerily. Avery felt like he was approaching a stranger and words felt foreign.\n\n\n\u201cHey Mal.\u201d he managed and they clasped shoulders. Avery did his best to feign heartiness.\n\n\n\u201cYou ready brother?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBorn ready.\u201d he returned, shaking off the thoughts as best he could as they turned to follow the path the deep winding tumbled stone road the gulch laid out before them.\n\n\nMal led the way. Avery followed. The sun blazed hot overhead. The stones beamed white and their shadows in dirty yellow. The sweat was already standing out on their skin. Avery looked at the back of Mal\u2019s head and the thought occurred to him, suddenly, to wonder what it would feel like to press the barrel of his revolver to it. Try as he might the thought kept fluttering back in like a butterfly to a flower. He had killed animals on the hunt many times before and a pistol made it quick.\n\n\nThe gulch led down to a stream bed where a trickle of water still ran from another source that pointed toward a mountain to the North. Mal stopped for a minute to drink and wet his head, grinning with the delight of the adventure. Avery copied him but only managed to look grim.\n\n\nThe boys followed the water downstream until it led to a small pool that did not seem to have an outlet. Here the clear water sat still having found some subterranean exit. On the other side of this pool was a small opening that was difficult to spot by daylight as the sun washed stones cast no shadow to give up the entrance. Here again they stopped.\n\n\nThe cave had formed when the flood pool filled. A large stone angled across nearly cut off the entire ravine propelled the floodwater directly at the wall of the ravine. The years of bygone torrents had torn into the side of the hill either due to many years of erosion but leaving the entrance disguised though surprisingly open and easy to enter. When it would rain this place was a deathtrap. They had seen it once. The risk of being battered into the rocks to drown was a likely ending for the rare event of rain in the desert.\n\n\nIn the carnage of such rare floods the sand and stone had uncovered many interesting things that beckoned the adventurers by the lure of coolness in the mouth of the cave. They found coins and occasionally shiny rocks that they could see through when they were held up to the sun.\n\n\nMal opened a bag and produced two lanterns, a box of matchsticks, coil of rope and roughly a dozen steel stakes.\n\n\nSomething moved as Mal lit the lantern. His face jerked to see.\n\n\n\u201cSnake.\u201d said Avery, \u201cCopperhead, I think.\u201d\n\n\nThe lanterns were raised high and they entered the cave cautiously. A few scorpions clung to the walls, but the deadness of all noise met their ears as if all of life had ceased on earth. The stones sweat near the entrance as the yawning coolness met them and tangled with the heat above.\n\n\nThe first chamber was almost perfectly round and strewn with boulders and gravel almost neatly piled in the middle. This was a second whirlpool formed from the first. But this one was bigger and because of a slight drop from the first whirlpool created a stronger and more violent flow. The ground sloped down in the middle and then back up to a ledge. Where it again sloped downhill as the water had cut a gentle spillway further into the cave.\n\n\n\u201cYou suppose there\u2019s a wildcat holed up in here?\u201d whispered Avery through the gloom.\n\n\n\u201cCould be anything,\u201d said Mal, the adventure in his voice, \u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d\n\n\nAvery marked their progress in chalk. As they walked the air grew yet staler. Mal looked at the flame of his lantern. \u201cWe need to be careful. I heard from others that gas comes out of the earth and can kill you. Either by exploding or by just not dying\u2026\u00a0 but we don\u2019t got a canary to tell us ahead of time.\u201d Mal drove a stake into the ground and lashed the rope to it. They would take turns, walking the hundred foot length. If someone passed out. The other would be able to pull them to safety without inhaling poisonous air.\n\n\nNow the stakes marked their progress. They switched back and forth a couple times before they came to a wall where the only further exit was through a black hole in the ground that their lanterns could not reach the bottom of. They sat at the edge thinking and eating, considering safety and feeling out the state of their bravery, before they went any further.\u00a0\n\n\nMal struck a match and once it was burning well tossed it into the opening; the two boys squinting after it. The match floated down merrily but as it sped it seemed to go out save the dim blue aura. But they saw nothing for a time until it bounced from rock to rock scattering into red sparks and died again into blackness.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDid you see that?\u201d Avery said excited.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Mal looking a question at his friend: he hadn\u2019t seen it.\n\n\u201cSomething reflected down there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might have just seen a spider eye looking back.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. But now I\u2019m curious.\u201d\n\n\nAvery tossed a rock. It fell silent for a four count.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cForty - maybe fifty feet.\u201d Avery said confidently. It was a cliff that in daylight they might have tried. But in the dark the going would be slow. This time a stake was driven, and another behind it. The rope was again lashed to the far one. Upon the second stake they wrapped a coil of rope around. The rope was then wrapped through the belt of Avery and Malcolm fastened himself to the end of it.\n\n\n\u201cWatch for scorpions. It\u2019s going to be too cold for snakes down here.\u201d\n\n\nThey began their descent. The rocks were dry here. If there had been any sort of wetness I\u2019m afraid both the boys would not have survived to tell the tale. As anyone who has attempted to climb a wet-clay rock can tell you. But the rocks held their foundations and nothing rolled out from under them, beyond a few loose pebbles that clattered like rain interspersed with hail somewhere in the deep black beyond them. They came to the bottom. For a moment they stood hearing nothing but the womb of the earth. They peered to the limits of their lanterns trying to see the whole of their surroundings. The caves went on in many directions. Here the air was stale so they both felt they were too close to each other. Avery stepped to the side and something snapped underfoot that rang like a curse in a foreign tongue in the midst of a nightmare.\u00a0\n\n\nHearts leapt in a lightning crescendo of fear.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d hissed Malcolm.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d Avery pleaded back. They raised their lanterns and let their eyes try to tell them what they saw. And when they did they bent closer. And when they saw they hoped to look away but there was nothing else to see. They recoiled before they knew what they were seeing.\u00a0\n\n\nA skeleton lay draped over the rocks, clothed in decent fashion, mummified in the dry earth. The reflection was from the metal belt buckle around its waist; a marking bearing a symbol they did not know but it was curiously memorable. An empty leather gun holster was at its hip. The boys looked it over a long time before either felt they could take a breath.\n\n\n\u201cI suppose he fell in here and couldn\u2019t find the way out.\u201d\n\n\nAvery put his hands through the pockets and found old cigars. The paper wrappers also bearing a curious emblem, and old matches.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI suppose he died in here and it flooded after?\u201d Avery offered.\n\n\n\u201cI dunno, if you were down here, how many matches would you not use before you gave up and died?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. Definitely dead before he got here.\u201d\n\n\nAvery swore immediately after.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Mal following Avery\u2019s pointed finger: there was a crisp round hole in the skull, right between the eyes. Mal swore too at this. And sat down in surprise.\n\n\nAs he sat the gloved hand gave a glimmer from the tangle of a fist of dried leather. Mal carefully tried to open the dead grasp. But as he did the glove pulled apart like dust had been the mortar that held it together. As the finger bones fell so also did two gold coins.\n\n\nThe boys whistled low as they picked them up to look them over. They were heavy and cold.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gold sure enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something on it...I can\u2019t make it out in this light.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet's get topside.\u201d\n\n\nAvery pocketed the coins and the brothers began their way up. Faster now, because they knew their way. As they climbed this dark rock face another thought entered Avery\u2019s mind. He was above Mal. The image came to him like a vision. To push a rock, not even a large one, at his fellow climber; it would be over quick. The gold would be his. No one would question his fortune. And no one would know of Mal\u2019s demise. And if he failed he could blame the very real danger they both were participating in. He reached the stake and the top. And thought, only for a half second, before he turned and assisted Malcom to the top by pulling up the rope that was fastened around Mal\u2019s waist.\n\n\nThey maneuvered back out of the cave, over the whirlpool and into the bursting daylight of the equatorial sun. The gold was too bright to see. They handed them back and forth a dozen times or so. Looking for clues as to what they were. Or to whose fortune they belonged. The lanterns they hid back in the opening of the cave. Promising and ensuring that they would return later.\n\n\n\u201cWhat kind of coin is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t from round here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink so? Maybe its older than the hills.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it's gold?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah. I have never seen so much before. But yeah. It's gold alright.\u201d\n\nMal wiped the sweat off his forehead. And they sat in the gentle soundless trickle of a motionless stream filling a very still pond.\n\n\u201cWho do you think he was?\u201d\n\nAvery shrugged and sat.\n\n\u201cHe either climbed down there and someone shot him... Or he was dead a long time? Washed in here years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow far up the gulch you been?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo farther than you.\u201d\n\nLooking North the gulch veered back and forth leading generally North by East. But it opened and crossed itself in flood cut oxbows as water sped through the paths of least resistance over the stretch of desert made desert by compact and unabsorbent earth. The boys set off following the gulch but using the compass to choose at the crossroads of washouts and tumbled rock. An hour brought them to a low upward angle that brought them to the desert level. They could see the mesa and the other plateaus that stood on their own. They could see the jagged cut of the gulch like a wound through the ground. The sun was closing on the horizon; the boys agreed they should head back. The excuse was that their water supply was low. They drank the last of their water while Avery sketched a map of the northern foothills. But in their reconnaissance they saw no clue as to where the body came.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat man either died between here and the cave.\u201d Malcolm thought out loud, \u201cOr somebody dumped him in the cave.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut then why didn\u2019t they take the gold?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was shot. That much is true. So it is pretty clearly murder.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe person who shot him was either after the gold. Or he was stopping him from something else. The gold just happened to be in his hand.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOr something else stopped the murderer from taking the gold from him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do with the coins?\u201d They started their walk back with this question on their minds.\n\n\n\u201cHow much do you think they are worth?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI dunno. The price of gold weight at least.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShould we keep it?\u201d\n\n\nTo find a coin on the ground in the middle of the desert leaves little wonder that the finder, in the lack of footprints to and from, ought to keep it. To find treasure in the hand of a dead man leaves the shadow of many questions that it could neither be called a gift nor could one take ownership by the pure neglect of the undefendable corpse.\n\n\n\u201cMaybe we should try to find out who he was first?\u201d said Mal.\n\n\nAvery nodded his head in squinting agreement and folded up his map and they began to head back to town.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do we do with the gold in the meantime?\u201d Mal asked aloud, half to himself half to Avery.\u00a0\n\n\nAvery thought about it. In his heart and dreams he wanted those riches. He even felt he needed them. But it irritated that at best he only got a share of them. He wanted to be the complete conqueror. But he knew he had no such claim. Another dark thought entered his mind.\n\n\n\u201cYou keep \u2018em.\u201d He said. The hollow of his eyes contradicted his words. He couldn\u2019t argue for a claim on them. He had no just cause. But he could argue a need; he could plead and ask Mal to not claim them; to help him in his struggle, his need to be independent(he had never felt he needed to be independant before now but the thought clearly came to his mind). It was no doubt that his friend would, without a doubt or hesitation, give all over to his brother. But pride alone held the boy to not put word to desire. The sting of asking was too much exposure to his covetous heart. No he would let Malcolm hold them. As a favor he could use this as leverage later.\n\n\nMal thought too before he answered. Avery was like his little brother. And a brother you can choose is always a greater friend than the blood brother you must know and put up with. Mal grinned seriously and looked him in the eyes.\n\n\n\u201cI will keep them secret.\u201d he vowed, \u201cI will find out their worth. And I will find out if we can indeed claim it. Whatever the case, reward or no, we found it together. This is the story we can tell our grandchildren about.\u201d\n\n\nThey clasped hands: nothing more needed to be said. They turned, at last, back onto the main road feeling as if their fortune was made. Dark thoughts and light ones intermingled in worry and adventure; following them.\n\nThey crossed the cornfield to the open pasture looking for it\u2019s guardian spirit to find that the girl had driven her cow home and was not there now to greet them. Their hope had been on this very thing, but now dusk was falling, and with it the hope to see her lay at The Goose.",

        "Trigger warning: drugs\n\nA rare, alien photgraph of an alien smoking a spliff and enjoying a lollipop... This rare race of alien has shapeshifted and camouflaged them self as a tattoo on a human leg, but the human whitnessess all expressed that they saw the alien transport them self away from the leg and into a very small spaceship.. \n\nThe humans who saw all this happen, informed me that they actually saw the alien ship crash, and were able to pick it up and take it to their house and had conversations with the alien, who openly admitted that he wouldn't be able to travel back to his planet until he was sober, as he had accidentally used human cannabis rather than the cannabis that comes from his realm (this will make a lot more sense later on in this article)\n\nThe humans (who I won't tell their names to protect their identity), spent a long time with the alien, who told them that he was from the future and that in our future, humans were transferring their brains/consciousness into these grey alien vessels to enable them to travel through space and time. \n\nThe alien told these humans some very interesting information: After the Roswell crash, the \"scientists and government\" were able to replicate the grey aliens body and anatomy and grow them to full size. The scientists/government had learnt from a different alien race, how to transfer their soul/consciousness into another vessel. One of these scientists had admitted to the grey alien that the \"rich\" and \"higher powers\" would soul jump/transfer their consciousness into already, living humans, and doing this became the cause of people suffering with schizophrenia, psycosis and split personality as conscious humans, like you and me, would all of a sudden be sharing their bodies with other humans and their souls. They explained that they would soul jump to average humans like you and I, to do things and perform tasks, from having romantic relations with others, to murdering people, and many other things, they also explained that they would inhabit other bodies so that they could experience life, not being famous, and would use this opportunity to be able to walk around without being recognised and mobbed by fans and paparazzi. \n\nThe people doing these things, started to offer \"soul jump experiences\", for a large price, rich/famous/high up, humans would be able to go through a \"menu\" of different experiences, and soul jump into different vessels to have these experiences..for example, the \"homeless experience\" would be purchased, a seperate human vessel would be selected, in this case, a homeless person, and the person paying for this experience will have their soul transferred into the homeless person, so that they can so experience what it's like to be homeless. \n\nThese \"high up, rich people\" are able to select very specific, detailed experiences, as they have the ability to monitor and watch the human race, they are able to find out everything about any human, enabling them to offer a variety of different experiences to those willing to pay for this.\n\nThe grey alien also told our witnesses that there are many \"average\" humans, like you and me, that also have \"sponsors\", because these \"experiences\" are not just exclusive to humans, but other alien races are able to pay for these experiences and see what life is like as a human. These people will watch us closely, find out about us in every detail, monitor us, follow us, so that they can make sure to pick the best experience, when their souls are finally transferred and connected to the human vessel, their experience begins for however long they like, because of this connection between the human who has had their vessel bought and the human which has bought the experience, they both start to learn about eachother very deeply, due to sharing a vessel and experiencing life together , and because these \"special humans\" and aliens know so much about us through this \"experiment\", it was decided that the humans, like you and me whose bodies can be inhabited, could have a sponsor. \n\nThe idea of the sponsor would be that when the \"rich/high up/special humans\" and aliens had decided to finish their \"average human experience\", they would pay a price for the human that they shared a vessel with, and depending on how much was spent, this would give them the ability to protect this human from any harm, influence their lives (non directly), for example, they are not allowed to interact or communicate with us physically and directly, but they could arrange to have a winning scratch card given to us when we purchase one in a shop, or they could \"hack into\" a slot machine that we were playing on to ensure that we win the money/jackpot, they could also improve our lives by making sure we receive the best medical services and an array of many other things. \n\nThe humans and aliens buying these experiences were creating deep bonds with their vessel partner. In some of these experiences, they would be sharing a vessel with a human who was experiencing a really tough life, abuse, bullying, homelessness, and because of this the \"vessel buyers\" would feel sorry for the person who's vessel they were inhabiting, which is why the sponsor program was created, so that their was the opportunity to take care of the human whose vessel they had used, almost like a thank you for letting them share your vessel/body with them.\n\nAfter being told this by our stoned grey alien, one of our human witnesses told us that they were a sufferer of psycosis and split personality, they had always had hallucinations and different personalities, but later on in their mid twenties, they began to hear a new voice/hallucination and also noticed that they were blacking out more often, while something else controlled their body. They explained how this lasted for almost over 20 years, until one day, the voice just stopped. However, they began to notice that they had constant good luck, their life had a complete turn around, they went from being very poor, unemployed, lonely, to coming into a lot of money, getting a good job and socialising with more people. This person had also experienced abuse for a long time but almost straight away after this \"hallucination\" left them, the person abusing them ended up getting into a very strange situation which meant that their abuser was no longer in their life and they were free from abuse. One thing they did notice, is that wherever they went, on most days, there was always a black helicopter that would fly very low right near them, circle a few times exactly where they were at that time and would fly off. They also noticed that if they felt fear or were in a situation where they may be at risk of being hurt by someone, the helicopter would appear almost instantly, fly around them in a circle and while the helicopter was around them, any threats would walk away or they would no longer feel scared.\n\nAfter hearing the story from the grey alien about sponsors, one of our witnesses realised that they had experienced sharing their soul with someone and that this person continued to sponsor them once they had left the experience. \n\nOur witnesses then went on to tell us that the grey alien went inside their ship for a brief period, and returned to the humans with a metal box. The grey alien opened the box and presented the humans with a variety of different things, in this box was a small white rock, a small sticky brown ball, a bright green red and purple bud which looked very similar to cannabis, there was a small vial of pink liquid, a small vial of blue liquid and a small vial of red liquid, there was a quantity of bright red mushrooms with white spots, and a variety of different coloured pills/tablets. The alien explained to the humans that these were proper, pure, \"drugs\", which were actually originally a technology, given to the humans from the grey aliens. However, this technology was not given to the government or any one in power, instead they were given, all around the world, to different people, just average humans, some addicts, some dealers, some completely sober people, this technology was given to a variety of different people. The alien then spent a very long time with these humans, experiencing these different \"drugs\" with them. The alien went on to explain, \"these, what your government call \"drugs\", were a technology from us, to you, average citizens, to enable you to see what is truly going on around you, what is hidden from you in plain site, to enlighten you. However, unfortunately those in power found out about this, and tried to obtain as much of the pure, original \"drugs\" as possible and modified everything by adding chemicals and ingredients which stop them from doing what they are supposed to, ensuring that this technology can't enlighten you or show you the truth, instead they modified our technology, named these things as \"drugs\" and made sure that when consuming these things, that they will damage your body, make you sick, disturb your mental health, make you paranoid, make you depressed. Doing this to our technology means that when people take these \"drugs\", that it will cause the consumer to vibrate on a very low frequency, stopping you from obtaining spiritual enlightenment and gaining knowledge. They modified our technology to also ensure that once you take them, that you will also be unable to reach enlightenment and truth while being sober too. Humans are able to reach truth and enlightenment and knowledge through a variety of things, such as meditation, so the people \"high up\" modified our technology so that it disables your sober ability to vibrate on a higher level and reach a spiritual height where you are able to gain knowledge and see the truth. You are able to reverse this, but the people engineering these \"drugs\", add chemicals to make them addictive, ensuring that you will get addicted and continue to use them, and therefore blocking all your spiritual ability and power. The \"drug technology\" that we originally gave to you was not addictive\"\n\nOur witnesses had a very eye opening experience, trying this pure technology. \nThe alien began to explain this technology further, \"I will refer to each technology with the name you associate with these \"drugs\" on Earth.\" The alien points, individually to each item and gives a description, firstly pointing to a purple tablet \"this is what you call \"speed\", it's original, technological name is Ekra-seekenam, when consuming this, it gives you the ability to see through the hologram that is projected into your sky to hide what is really going on \"behind closed doors\", if you will\"\nThe humans tried the Ekra-seekenam with the Alien, and they almost passed out from shock. As they all looked up into the night sky, they could see army planes, flying and darting through the air, shooting bullets at other, unknown ships, while you could see different types of ships, some shooting lasers, dog fighting, a full war in the sky. As they looked up at the stars, they soon noticed that the stars were not big balls of fire, far, far away, but that they were all individual stations, they stared in awe as they witnessed a \"star\" split in half and open up, followed by a fleet of ships flying out of the \"star\" and across the sky. In the distance, they see a bit, round ship, almost shaped like a helicopter, with a huge, bright, white beam of light, shining out of the bottom, and scanning the earth below, back and forth. \n\nOur witnesses also went on to tell us how they also experienced taking the Ekra-seekenam in the day time, where they whitnessed lots of red, laser like dots, fleeting around the sky, and literally pulling clouds together and creating clouds out of thin air. They also witnessed \"airplanes\" which had turned completely see through, and behind this apparition of an airplane, you could see ships, trying to camouflage themselves with the image of a plane.\n\nThe alien proceeded to share the technology with the humans, he points to the small vial, filled with red liquid \"this is what you call \"mdma, Mandy, Molly\", it's real name is Passapassa. Before this wonderful technology was messed with by those who should not be in power, when consumed, it gives you the ability to have clear, vivid memories of who you were and what you did in your past lives. It gives you the ability to remember as much as you want to seek and know. Once consumed for the first time, your soul, body and mind will come to a complete balance, every particle of you, every fibre of you, every memory you have had in this life and your past life's, every body you have reincarnated into, every different name you have had, all of your many personalities, every single breath you have taken since the beginning of time, will accumulate into a huge, spiritual, magical, bubble and you will experience complete union with your soul\", one of our witnesses, who we will refer to as M, told us how after taking Passapassa, she looked down at her hands, and explained, \"I looked down at my hands, which looked so different to how they usually look, and I thought to myself, \"my hands, these hands, they're somebody else's hands, but they're hands that I recognise\", they were hands which had written letters, hands which had brushed my hair and washed my face, hands which had held the hand of my soul mate, but not from this life. Instantly, it was like my soul was communicating with me, whispering in my ear to tell me a magical secret, but before I had the chance to hear this wonderful secret, I looked at my reflection in the mirror, and Infront of me was not my reflection, but many reflections, many faces, many bodies, many ages and many sizes, it was like I was looking at the TV, and being shown woman after woman after woman, flicking through all these different characters and personalities, and even though I had never seen any of these women before, I knew, straight away who these women were, and my soul finally confirms to me through its ethereal whispers \"you're looking at yourself, who you were in all your many, past lives\" \nThe alien continued with its lesson, \"with this great union of the soul, connecting to all your reincarnated bodies and memories, the Passapassa also enables you to retain the knowledge of everything you have learnt, from your first life, to your last. You will only be able to search for knowledge when you have consumed Passpassa, once it has left your system, your memories and your knowledge will return to what you have experienced and gained in this life, as being able to remember everything from all of your reincarnations, would be too much for your mind to handle and you would no longer be able to function anymore. Let me open your eyes to something, while under the effect of Passapassa, search through all of your memories, all of the places you've been and things you've seen, and draw, write, paint, sculpt. Imagine, searching through your memory back to the time when the Egyptians depicted being visited by sky beings so that you can truly see what the Egyptians saw then too, and then draw what you see, write in your journal how the world was back then, so that when the Passapassa has emptied out of your system, you will be able to look back at your drawings and writings and reveal to yourself the truth of the things which remain unknown.\"\n\nA question was presented to the alien by one of the group, let's refer to him as B. B, as well as the rest of the group, had a realisation after listening to the aliens lesson, \"The egyptians, the Romans, the Aztec, the aborigines, the Sumerians, all of these civilizations, maybe they had taken Passapassa, and had the same idea as you, to seek through their memories and interpret all of their experiences through sculptures, through hieroglyphics, through cave paintings and stories, written on stone tablets, on cave walls, in books. Maybe they weren't visited by sky beings, but they were depicting a past life when they were visited by ethereal beings\"\n\nThe alien continued with his presentation to the group, \"Well B, if you ever experience Passapassa again, you will be able to discover somewhat of the truth, just remember to write it down or draw it, so that you can teach yourself when you are sober. Anyway, let us continue\" the alien places the vibrant, green, red and purple bud into the palm of their hand, \"this, to you is cannabis, to us it is Lardna Oznas. That poison you call cannabis is the reason I crashed my ship! These days, they have got quite good at making \"the weed\" look like authentic Lardna! Unfortunately for me, I was fooled, and I imbibed some human weed, thinking it was Lardna, and the way my body and mind has evolved, I can no longer control what happens to me when I take human drugs\"\n\nThe alien and the group try the Lardna Oznas, this is the third technology that they have tried and we were informed by the group that the Lardna was completely different to the previous technologies that they had already tried. The group had told us that the Lardna Oznas was very unique but incredibly fun and exciting. A third member of the group, who we will refer to as S, had exclaimed that there is nothing on planet Earth that compares to the levels of fun they experienced while taking Lardna, and couldn't wait to tell us why they loved it so much.\n\nAfter a lot of fun, laughs and giggles, the group and the alien all sat down, exhausted, into soft chairs, and had a small tea break. With coffee in hand, our alien continued to enlighten the group, \"Lardna Oznas, I guess from my realm, this would be our equivalent of a \"recreational drug\", and while technically this is still a technology, it wasn't made for the purposes of enlightenment, or knowledge, or to give you any special abilities, but simply created for pure, energetic, endless fun. We all need to let our hair down sometimes, it's important to get in touch with our inner child sometimes and experience pure joy, which is why Lardna Oznas was made by us and given to you humans, because from our observations, you are a very pessimistic, sad and depressive race, and if I had the power, I would five Ladnas to everyone, and all war would cease. I don't need to explain this one in detail as you have just experienced the joy which it brings but it was Ladnas that gave humans the idea and technology to create Virtual Reality, simulators and I'm sure it influenced the creation of gaming full stop\"\n\nB, S and M were all incredibly enthusiastic when telling us about Ladnas. We were told that Ladnas gave our group the ability to make their imagination come to life. After taking the Ladnas, they were all individually teleported to wherever their imagination decided to take them and they had an experience, almost exactly like playing with virtually reality, except there was no VR headset, instead they physically became part of whatever world and experience they created.\n\nS told us that he was teleported to the room in Willy Wonkas factory where everything was edible and he experienced, EVERYTHING perfectly. He ate and ate and ate, all the sweets and chocolate and candy until he was full and even then, he continued to eat everything around him. He told us that it was such a perfect and unique experience, something that he had always dreamed and wished of doing, but never thought it would be possible to do, until he met his alien friend.\n\nB chose to experience going back the Viking times, where he fought in battle after battle after battle, and took full advantage of the fact that he could die a million times during his Ladnas experience, and took part in as many battles as possible. During his experience, B also had the opportunity of meeting all the pagan Gods and he was really excited to tell us that he was able to hold Mjolnir (Thors hammer)\n\nM's chaotic and eccentric personality reflected in her Ladnas experience as she went from place to place to place, she tried to embrace her experience as best as possible, and really used her imagination to do as many different things as possible, she spent some time surrounded by cute, beautiful little puppies, then went to a rollercoaster park, which she had all to herself so she could go on every ride without having to queue, she spent some time in a spa, getting the world's best massage, she even flew around the world to try all sorts of different food, sweets, desserts, ice cream, fast food and everything else that she could think of having. M managed to do a million different things, we would be here all day trying to talk about all of her different experiences ...\n\n\nTo be continued...",
        "So I\u2019m in school and I was going to my next class. I\u2019m listening to music and Banana Man by Tally Hall comes on and you wouldn\u2019t believe it but someone in a banana costume walks past me. I\u2019m still going crazy about it since it happened to me like 10 minutes ago (as of posting this) like what we\u2019re the odds of happening.",
        "Few days ago, I was on a marathon. The weather was bad, there was a lot of mud and water puddles, and it was raining. I didn't care much, but its important to the story.\nI came on the finish line, my pants were brown becouse of mud, and I was almost fully wet.\nSo I got to the car, took my bckpack and came back soaking wet.\nThe finish was in front of an old museum, the building is very old, before ww2. So I came in, I went up small stairs and I got into a hallway. Empty hallway on the left, empty hallway on the right. Great.\nI unpacked my sweatshirt, undershirt, clean pants and shoes. I put everything on small \"fences\" on the wall that represented old fences. I took off my pants, I was in underpants, active shirt and club tshirt on top. I decided to take off my t-shirt becouse there was nobody there, and as I was taking it off, I lifted my head.\nOH BOY! I started to believe that there is matrix and it glitched. 10 people spawned in front of me. In 2 seconds 10 people spawned in hallway, people were coming out of other rooms, there were children running around me, idk how. People were just entering that hallway all at once, it was like a scene from Police Academy.\nSo, I decided to do it like my great grandfathers did. I went in a room, put my dry clothes on 100 year old chair and swapped my clothes. Thankfully noone saw that, but I just felt embarrased while putting everything in the bags from the hallway.\nTLDR:I was wet from toe to head. I went inside a museum to change my clothes in hallway. 10 people literally spawned while I was changing. I did it like they did 100 years ago, on the same chairs.",

        "So at school I was given an English assignment where I was given a series of questions that were basically just mini writing prompts asking us to describe the perfect Halloween party. I actually thought that was kinda cool. Here\u2019s what I wrote down:\n\n**Q: Where is this party located?**\n\nOk, the best Halloween party would be up in the mountains that make up the border of the valley and Downtown Los Angeles. Like, on Mulholland.\n\n**Q: Where is this party located?**\n\nIdeally it would be a big, multistory house owned by me.\n\n**Q: What year was this house built?**\n\nThe house was probably built in the 20th century.\n\n**Q: When will the party occur?**\n\nThe party starts at 7 PM.\n\n**Q: Who is invited?**\n\nMy friends will be invited and they are allowed to bring along 2 people of their choosing.\n\n**Q: Describe the house.**\n\nThe house uses Spanish-Moorish style architecture. The walls outside are made up of brightly colored stucco.\n\n**Q: Describe the graveyard.**\n\nI have a cheap looking fake graveyard in the backyard.\n\n**Q: Describe the guests.**\n\nI suppose the guest of the night would be some guy who\u2019s semi-famous in LA. An up and coming star in the star in the local underground/indie music scene.\n\n**Q: What will be served at the party?**\n\nI\u2019ll probably just get lazy with food and just leave chips and beer all around the house. Maybe I\u2019d order some pizzas too.\n\n**Q: What kind of music will be played?**\n\nThe soundtrack to tonight\u2019s party consists of a highly premeditated list of doom, stoner, and death-doom metal music. Bands that are featured consist of, but are not limited to; Black Sabbath, Paradise Lost, and Electric Wizard.\n\n**Q: Describe something special that will occur at midnight.**\n\nAt midnight I tell everyone to fuck off. Does that count?\n\n**Q: Describe how the party went.**\n\nI would hope that the party goes really well and is awesome. People would be spending time drinking, dancing, doing hard drugs, try to fuck in both small secluded spaces inside the house and right outside of the house; probably in some bushes or something, getting into antics that lead to shit getting broken, and generally shooting the shit and gossiping about people they barely even know, if even that. At one point this guy almost OD\u2019d because he had the bright idea of seriously shooting up pure black tar heroin on the toilet in the bathroom upstairs. Luckily, a friend of a friend figures out something\u2019s up and when opening the bathroom door, unannounced, finds him almost about to die. He shouts out to get help until someone who happened to have some narcan on hand goes over there and saves the dude\u2019s life. Those guys were fucking heroes..\n\n**Q: State how many people were scared to DEATH.**\n\nNobody was cared to death because we\u2019re not fucking children.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOriginally posted here: [https://i-me-and-myself.neocities.org/halloweenspecial.html](https://i-me-and-myself.neocities.org/halloweenspecial.html)",
        "The guards literally ordered a hit/beating on a guy. \n\nThis is my first time being arrested, I am in county awaiting trial. Only been in a few weeks and I am the fish, the newest member in the tank. We\u2019re kitchen workers and janitorial services. We got perks that other inmates don\u2019t have like comfortable blankets (not just sheets), pillows, TV is on 24/7, day room is always open, we\u2019re never on lockdown, plus we get to eat what the guards eat. Not morgue bologna, but actual food. How I got that gig day on one was due to overcrowding. \n\nI walk into a 70 man tank. There is a sign, \u201cThe Lions Den\u201d carved in the concrete. My ID says I am White so the leader of the Whites, also a Russian comes to me and gives me the rules. I quickly explain that \u201cI am a Russian Gypsy, I don\u2019t think you want me.\u201d He quickly replied, \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right, we don\u2019t want you. Just remember, you\u2019re in the Lion\u2019s Den and I am the #1 lion.\u201d I let out a smirk and a short laugh, like letting air out of your nose. He asked if he said something funny and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a Russian saying, nevermind.\u201d He stands and demands to know the saying. I don\u2019t want to, but now I have to. \u201cThe saying goes, Lions may be king of the jungle, but wolves never perform in the circus.\u201d He laughed, he said it was funny and then punched me dead in the temple. I didn\u2019t go down. I know I can tare him apart like a roasted chicken, but he has numbers. I took a few more and went down. \n\nThis was my college education. This is where I learned how jail/prison works. Never take anything for free. People will offer you deodorant, coffee, candy, cigs, a joint but don\u2019t ever take it. One way or another you\u2019re going to pay it back in a way you don\u2019t want to. An older guy taught me the ropes. I still thank God he was my bunky (slept in bunk below me). I\u2019d get lessons nightly on how to act, react, what meant what, etc. Old guy took a liking to me and I am glad he was below me in that bunk. He never asked what I did and while I did ask what he did, he said it didn't matter.\n\nThe leader asks me to put in some work, make a delivery in the janitor bucket. Fill it up with water, soap, make suds then when I am near a specific cell, whistle and move the bucket near that cell and let the guy take the package. I decline. Again I am asked, and again I decline. Respectfully I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been sentenced yet. If I get TIME, I\u2019ll be proud to work for you. But if I get a few months, I\u2019d like to do it quietly and peacefully.\u201d Dead eye tells me that peace and quiet aren\u2019t free, they are a commodity that he can provide at a price and he walks away. \n\nOG tells me I am going to get my ass kicked and to be prepared. I ask if I can fight back, he said sure, just watch for shivs. Shivs? FML. So I am waiting and then I am called over to the table to play cards. I am dealt a hand, not even sure what game we\u2019re playing and then I hear, \u201cThe easy way or the fun way.\u201d Politely I ask what that meant. I either fight one guy in the showers toe to toe or I get jumped. Immediately I say one on one, and I stand to my feet. I am huge, I know how to fight. Got years of experience in boxing and martial arts. \u201cLets go.\u201d Oh shit, we\u2019ll go, he\u2019s waiting for you. \n\nA huge guy. Naked. To place him on tilt a little, I get naked. Odd right? But put yourself in his place, you think you\u2019re going to give a beating and then this guy walks in ready for it and also gets naked while making eye contact. It\u2019s weird, strange, but that\u2019s what I was going for. He throws a punch, I side step it. Throws another, again I side step it. Throws an uppercut, I simply step back one step. He leans his head down and charges, I spin left and he misses me, but he\u2019d bent at the waist. Throws a punch and I grab his arm and get him in a hold where I can easily pop it out of place. He grunts, I slap his back and jump to my feet while backing up. He right hooks, I duck, then easily got him in a rear choke hold. I was going to choke him out but I let him get some air and again he attacks. Had to throw a few hits to get him to quit. I put my clothes on and walk out and sat back down at the table. Hair messy, a little blood on my face, but I picked up the cards like nothing happened. The leader laughs and says, \u201cI actually need you.\u201d I replied, \u201cLet\u2019s see what my sentence is and we\u2019ll go from there. May I go to sleep?\u201d He motions with his hands. The next morning I go about my shift. Who is working with me? Mr naked fighter. I reach my hand out for a handshake and ask, \u201cWe cool? I didn\u2019t ask for it and neither did you.\u201d He gives a weak handshake and shoves my hand away. Not sure how to take it, but at least he knows toe to toe I own him. \n\nMy nickname is the fish. Fish this, fish that, any shitty job it\u2019s the fish that does it. Until a new fish comes in. I don\u2019t like my place, but I put myself here.\n\nI am fully acclimated. I know the routines and am no longer the fish. I start a prayer group and Bible study. It\u2019s going well. I believe in Jesus, God, Holy Spirit, Bible, all of it, including demons and demonic possession. Not trying to convert or convince you, your beliefs are yours and mine are mine. I am just giving some insight to me personally. \n\nThe main guard. Huge, bulging, trapezoid muscles start at his ear lobes, looks like he has on a bullet proof vest at all times, 6\u20196\u201d easily, bald, white and only part of his face that isn\u2019t red is from the Oakley sunglasses he wears constantly that are around his neck with the Oakley band. He starts handing out USA Today news papers, the full color news paper. It\u2019s opened to a huge photo of a man who abducted a little girl, raped and killed her, then took photos of her and her DNA was all over his car and his body. His DNA was all over hers as well. I don\u2019t know what this means but a huge guy tells me \u201cHe\u2019s gonna get fed to the lions tonight boy!\u201d I still don\u2019t get it. Old man says, \u201cSeen how he handed out the paper, opened to that page and just nodding. Odds are that guy is in our building and coming into our tank for a while.\u201d Oh shit. A wave of fear hits me. A few hours later, that guy in the paper is in our tank. Shaved head, from full beard to goatee and \u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t explain what I felt. He came over to shake hands and introduce himself which was the rules of our tank. His paperwork says a different name, GTA and evasion with police brutality. Normally that is royalty, but we all know it\u2019s fake. He comes to shake my hand. I turned my back on him, while his set (South Siders a.k.a. Mexicans) take him in like royalty. He said his name was Oscar. \n\nAfter count, that same huge guard nods and walks away. All I hear is a heavy Mexican accent saying, \u201cOscar, come play hearts with us.\u201d No thanks, I had a long day. \u201cOscarito, Oscar-eeeeto, aqui arrhhorta.\u201d My little Oscar, little Oscar, HERE! NOW! He comes, he sits, I got a clean view of it all. Then they deal him in, and they use his real name. Let\u2019s pretend it\u2019s Hector. \u201cWhy did you do that Hector?\u201d Do what? My name is Oscar. \u201cHector. Don\u2019t play me for a fool. Was it fun? Was your dick all hard and shit like mine is now?\u201d The cards are shaking in his hands. I can\u2019t turn away. Boom, one guy hits him in the back of his head and the beating starts. Imagine 25 guys on one. Biting fingers, biting feet, punching limbs, it was like a demonic possession. I can\u2019t turn away. Maybe 20 seconds at most. Then a flashbang goes off. Ever seen an actual flashbang? You partially hear it, then you go deaf and hear ringing, you can see but you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re seeing. Total and 100% disorientation. We\u2019re told to go on the floor, yet I can\u2019t. I am pulled down to the floor and we stood with our hands behind our heads, face on the ground. Dogs were called in, guards dragged him out. We stood like that for a good 30 seconds. Then one wakes up and starts to giggle, then they all start to laugh. I\u2019m still in position. I don\u2019t believe what I just seen. Old man gets me off the ground and says, \u201cKeep your fucking mouth shut! SHUT!\u201d \n\nMaybe 10 mins later the new fish is called in, then the next lowest, then next lowest, then me. Same huge guard. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I said I don\u2019t know, I was masturbating in the shitter, sir. Again, \u201cWHAT DID YOU SEE?!?\u201d Again, I was masturbating in the shitter, sir. I kept that up for 2 or 3 minutes. \u201cJust tell me what you seen and we\u2019ll place you in PC (protective custody) and it\u2019ll be OK. Now tell me what you seen.\u201d WHAT DID I SEE? I SEEN MY HAND GOING UP AND DOWN MY DICK THEN I HEARD A BANG! WOULD YOU LIKE A RE-ENACTMENT?!?!\u201d I was dragged out, taken back to the lions den. The big guard nodded. A nod? Is that good? Is that bad? Am I fucked? I run to old man and ask, explain what I said t to the guard and he said a nod is good, a no or a no eye contact is bad. You did good.\n\nThe next morning, there is a spread out on the table. Candy, chips, chocolate milk, biker mags, playboys, all sorts of fun contraband. It was a reward. Guards wanted it taken care of and the lions did their job.\n\nAbout a month later, I got court and I am to be released within 4 weeks. Word gets out. The #1 comes to me and says that with a month left, I owe him work. How did he know? A few others had court that day too and we all knew what the other got. So now I am on high alert. They don\u2019t like people that are going home to BBQs, pussy, family. Old man tells me to watch my back even more. The old man was highly connected but you\u2019d never know it, I never knew it. He suggested I get into a fight with somebody, anybody and make it good to spend 30 days in the hole and he promised I wouldn\u2019t catch another case. So, I went for #1. I know it's a fight, I know it's a problem, but he's the only one I want. I also know that a month in the hole is no joke. As I sit, scared out of my mind, trying to convince myself to go after somebody else, the only guy that deserves it is #1, everyone else is cool. I can't attack somebody who did nothing to me, but I want him. I am sitting trying to figure out how and when, when a small, tiny yet very scary guy comes to me and says, \"Here, take this.\" It's food. I know not to take anything, so I say \"No thank you.\" He says, \"Don't be afraid. You'll need it. I was asked to give it to you, it's free. His name was Angel. Old man can't be found. I walk up to #1 and ask if he wants to meet me in the shower to talk about a little work. He leads, I follow, we fight. I walk out and run towards the bars. I am taken to the hole. \n\nDid 28 days in the hole. No case. I was released from the hole and taken home by a escort. Now, we\u2019re going from one county to another county. Right at the L.A. county line, there is a gas station, McDonalds and an In-N-Out Burger. I am released from one car, uncuffed and in my street clothes. I got $25 in my pocket and a check for about $200. While the four cops are talking, I simply walk over to In-N-Out and place my order. Two Double Doubles, animal style, animal fry and Neapolitan shake. My number is called and I grab one burger and walk toward my escort. The drew their guns on me and there are 10 squad cars in the lot. \u201cOn your knees!\u201d I go on my knees. Burger in one hand, bag and shake in other. Drop the food and lay face on the ground! I took a huge bite, then took another and then dropped my food and went face down. I am cuffed and now they\u2019re discussing what to do with me. Dogs are barking, cops yelling, I am chewing my burger yet my eyes wont get off the bag I left on the floor. \u201cShould we take him back or straight to the judge?\u201d I blurt out, \u201cNobody told me I couldn\u2019t go, nobody cuffed me after I was uncuffed, I came straight back to you guys. Hope the dash cams were on.\u201d They all stare at eachother, you didn\u2019t cuff him? No, I thought you did. \u201cSee, nobody cuffed me, you guys were talking so I went to go eat. Can I get that bag, PLEASE?\u201d They talk some more, I keep asking for the bag and if I can please go home. Either way, court or judge or home, can I please get my bag. The woman looks at me and gets my bag (after searching it), and I am cuffed to the bar. \u201cWe\u2019re taking you home. This is too much to deal with on a Friday.\u201d I can\u2019t reach my bag, yet I can smell it. \n\nI am welcomed home by family, wife, kids, dog, mom, friends, balloons, yellow ribbons all over the tree (tie a yellow ribbon on the old oak tree if you\u2019ll wait for me, if you still love me, Tony Orlando & Dawn). \n\nI wrote to the old man for a few years. He said he called in a favor so I don\u2019t catch a case. He then tells me that there were Federal agents and cops inside the lions den with us, and that\u2019s why he always told me to be quiet. I used to send him pics, books, put money on his books, then he writes that he is being released and doesn\u2019t want to contact me again. Why? I had no clue. Maybe he wanted to forget. But I\u2019ll never forget man. Wild Bill we called him. Name didn\u2019t fit, it was William and he was calm as calm can be and cool as ice. \n\nA tiny piece of me thinks he was a fed or a cop. Why? Not sure. But from future experiences, I did find out there are always cops and feds inside jails and prisons to get info. I am also convinced that the guy who gave me the food, was an Angel. \"Don't be afraid.\" He fed me. Maybe he was a molester named Angel, a common Mexican name, but I like to think it was an Angel.",

        "Met him at what i would call \"rehabilitation for children with trauma/issues\". It was a weekend thing once or twice a month, depending on what you wanted. I'd been there for some time and knew everybody, i kinda turned into one of the adults (with that i mean there were adults working there, they were super chill tho).\nBack to the kid, we'll call him Bobby.\nBobby came as the new kid and all of us who had been there for some time welcomed him. He was kinda quiet at first, but the next day he was so loud.\n(He had anger issues and some diff shit, buuut, i didn't know then,) i was distancing myself from him after noticing he was a bit too much.\nThe group went out in the evening after some activities at daytime, we wanted to play hide 'n seek in the dark. I kid you not, i hid, Bobby followed me and said to me \"i touch myself thinking about you\". Alarmed about what he had just told me, i went inside and told the adult, they reacted the way i did and had a conversation with Bobby (More alarming, i met this kid one day ago). Through the night he apparently talked about me in sexualy and gross ways to the other kids, they got angry and annoyed (since they knew me pretty well) and told me in the morning. Most of us chose to distant ourselves from Bobby because of his behavior. (Keep in mind, we didn't know at this time things would escalate, and i hadn't cought the information about his issues yet) \n\nA month goes by and then there's the next time, we all meet, say hello to Bobby still weirded out by last time and i go to take a shower before dinner. Bobby tried to jump and look trough the window so he could see the bathroom from the outside, i had to hang a towel up over the window (the window was pretty small, maybe 20x20cm and high up on the wall). Went out when i was done and told the adults. They obviously got more angry than i did, after all i was tired of the bs Bobby was pulling, but this program was supposed to be a safe space. \n\nNext day, i didn't know what happend, but Bobby hit another kid pretty hard after they yelled at him (i later found out Bobby was talking about another girl in a sexual way again). Then the adults came and had a real talk with him, Bobby went crazy, had the most ugly tantrum i had ever heard. Two of the adults and Bobby talked outside, while the rest of us were inside. Like i said, he went crazy, he started hitting and kicking one of the adults, while the other adult tried to keep him back. I think we all understood, both children and adults, that he was going to get kicked out of the program. He did, they drove him home on the spot that night. But when Bobby walked in to get his stuff, he had the most ugly grin on his face like he had done something so great. \n\nSo yeah, that's my story",
        "Pumpkin was a Beebear with leaves in their hair & also they could not see & also they had bees in their eyes & also liked to paint all the time because of the shiny, pretty colors.\n\nOne day, when Pumpkin rode their bicycle to the Canyon, they realized if they only painted while the Rain was pouring down, the colors would blend together, & they could make a Giant Painting on the Walls of the Canyon that they would be able to see even without any glasses!\n\nUnfortunately, they could not Enjoy their Painting because it was not Finished & also because they had bees in their eyes all the time.\n\nThe painting took so long to finish that Pumpkin started to get very hungry.\n\nThen Mr. Turtle sent a message through the crowpigeons, \"Why Don't You Come Back To The Clocktower Arena. You have to write grants for us because we will not give you a nice hat if we don't have lots of Money.\"\n\nThen Pumpkin realized if they filled their Clothes with paint, it would spill out while they were walking & it would turn the Whole World into a Beautiful Painting!\n\nAs Pumpkin approached the Arena, they took their last bite of Burrito & realized that Mr. Turtle was going to take away Pumpkin's bed & make Pumpkin sleep on the floor (& Pumpkin LIKED sleeping on the floor but they did not like being Yelled At)\n\nSo Pumpkin ran back & found a Rock covered in paint & then they drew a smiley face & a dinosaur on the Rock. When they got to the Clocktower, they saw Mr. Turtle & said, \"here is a rock that i painted just for you that you can sell and get lots of Money\" & Pumpkin was Lying but Mr. Turtle did not care because he liked Money, & because Pumpkin reminded him of when he was small & cared about stuff like painting & singing.\n\nThe next morning, Pumpkin stayed inside writing grants so they would not get yelled at, but they were not thinking about money, they were only thinking about how Beautiful the Sky was when it Rained & about all the Beautiful things they could paint.\n\nAs they were in the library looking for a book about quantum physics & how cutting down all the Trees in the Canyon would get lots of Money for the Arena, they saw a book about a Fox named Fog Joplin who lived in the desert. All the Trees in the whole desert were on Fire, & Nobody knew, so Fog sailed across the Ocean to find the Clocktower, but when she got there, Mr. Turtle locked her in the basement of the Arena for a hundred years! Well, this would not do, so Fog learned how to talk to mice & asked them to steal Mr. Turtle's keys for her. Then she snuck out of the Arena at midnight when the wind was howling & tied banana leaves to her hands & used them to fly over the walls of the Arena!\n\nThen Pumpkin found a book about an abandoned cave network that went through the side of the Mountain, connecting the top of the Canyon to the entrance to the Clocktower. The book also talked about a Brook fed by a magical Spring, & that in the old days people used to believe if you drank the Springwater, you would never get tired or need to eat or drink again.\n\nThat summer, Pumpkin went into the Jungle for a whole month listening to all the Sounds of the Jungle during the day & watching the Stars at night. They remembered Fog's story & started to cry because they knew Mr. Turtle wanted to cut down the entire Jungle.\n\nWhile they were walking back to the Clocktower, they thought of a funny song: \"i hate money & i like Rain. i like to fill Mr. Turtle's shoes with Paint.\" They sang it to themselves the whole way back because it was so funny.\n\nWhen they made it to the Clocktower, their friends were all waiting. Pumpkin said, \"let's fill our pockets with paint & run around on the main Field of the Arena until we slip & fall from the Paint everywhere & whoever's standing last wins!\" & everyone ran around with Paint because it was so fun & the whole time Pumpkin sang the song they had thought of earlier: \"I HATE MONEY & I LIKE RAIN! I LIKE TO FILL MR. TURTLE'S POCKETS WITH PAINT!\"\n\nWhen Mr. Turtle came down from the Clocktower, he was very angry. He yelled at Pumpkin for making a mess of the coliseum. Pumpkin did not like being yelled at & wanted to get away. So Pumpkin said \"maybe you should punish me by sending me to the Jungle so i remember not to make a mess of the Arena.\" & when Mr. Turtle sent Pumpkin away, Pumpkin finally felt like they could Breathe. They walked to the Jungle, took some time to sit and listen to the Sounds, gathered as many banana leaves as they could carry, & headed for the Canyon.\n\nIt rained, & rained, & rained, & Pumpkin was finally able to paint their Painting in peace. They found the Mountain Spring at the top of the Canyon, & every twenty minutes they would pick up a Rock that had got Paint on it, walk to the entrance of the Caverns, & throw it into the waters. When they had been out in the wilds for several days, they sewed their banana leaves together into two halves of a collapsible raft, & used it to sail down the river through the caves all the way back to the Clocktower. They dug a hole in the dirt & filled it with painted rocks that had been carried all the way down the river. They took three rocks to Mr. Turtle & said \u201cthese are from the Jungle, they reminded me of how you said you liked to get creative when you were younger. did you draw that portrait of the Eagle behind your desk?\u201d\n\nMr. Turtle looked back & said, \u201cYes, I did, actually!\u201d but as he turned around, Pumpkin could see that his butt was covered in paint & Pumpkin thought that was very funny.\n\nPumpkin left & walked through the Clocktower halls & saw little traces of color everywhere, & even though it was hard to make out the details because of the bees in their eyes, Pumpkin thought it was so Beautiful.\n\nThat night, they opened the two halves of their magical banana leaf raft into a pair of wings, just like Pumpkin had Hoped. They carried the wings to the highest point of the Arena walls & waited for a strong wind. When it came, & it surely came, they were able to fly. They flew over the Jungle, the Ocean, the Desert, & finally made it back around to the Canyon where they could paint. The moon rose & fell many times during this period, & sometimes it rained (& sometimes didn\u2019t) but eventually Pumpkin was able to sit back & enjoy what everyone had made together. They drank from the Spring again & laid back against a Tree as the Rain started to fall. This was when they remembered they were still hungry.\n\n\u201cwhat a good day today was,\u201d thought Pumpkin, \u201ci wish all my friends were here to enjoy it with me.\u201d\n\nWhat Pumpkin didn\u2019t know is their friends were all there with them in their Heart.\n\nWhat Pumpkin did know is they would see each other Soon.",
        "It was the paper route, dropping of papers in every waiting room in the west side of the hospital. It was late October so every desk had candy on it. I grabbed some tootsie rolls at x-ray\u2026\n\nAfter delivering papers to a couple of tables with few chairs I hit the emergency room. It was quiet only a couple groups of people and a handful of loners. I went and placed a newspapers on the tables. Sitting next to one of the tables was a nice looking lady with a kidney bowl of clear slime in front of her. I saw her from her side as she heaved. clear thick bile came from her mouth and into the kidney bowl. She had to spit to get the strings of vomit off her lips. I recognized the bowl, they were used for many things, scissors, knives, used tissues, blood and now vomit. When I came over she looked at me and strained, holding. The smell was noticeable but not terrible. Some rooms smelled aromas you tried to forget. The worst smells tended to come from the showers. Some sort of smell that came  from some deep diseased skin. No amount of soap could get rid of it. \nI smiled and placed a fresh paper on top of the old torn one. She smiled back through her sweat. As I left I heard her heave a splat into that kidney bowl.",

        "Note: This story, Despite taking place in the Marvel Universe, is not an official Marvel story nor are these characters official.\n\n\n\n\nIn a multiverse, anything is possible. From little differences like What If the solar system was one planck length to the left, to huge things like What If Thanos won in Endgame. In this multiverse, there's one reality, What if the Infinity Stones all ended up on Asgard.\n\n\nThe Infinity Stones. Gems with almost unlimited power. In Universe 616 and most others, upon their creation they were spread out across the universe. In this universe, Universe 19,678, they all landed on the planet Asgard. The Asgardians put them in Vibranium orbs and put those orbs into swords. These 6 swords were known as The Infinity Swords. Every 100,000 years, 6 of Asgards strongest soldiers were chosen to inherit the swords. These soldiers were known as The Infinity Warriors. Eren, head of the Royal Guard, was chosen to inherit the Power Sword. It was going well, until 25,000 years after he was chosen.\n\n\nA red mechanical face appeared in the sky with the Mind stone in its forehead. A portal opened as swarms of droids flooded Asgard. One more Droid appeared, but it was different. It was that being that appeared in the sky. It had all 6 Stones, and it had Vibranium armor and a huge Lance.\n\n\nThe Infinity Warrior with the Time Sword, fought. He made a time loop to trap the robot, but it shattered the Loop and murdered him. The warrior with the Mind Sword tried casting an illusion on the robot, but it was immune. The one with the Reality Sword tried turned the robots armor to dust, but its own Reality Stone canceled it out. They all fought hard, but fell.\n\n\nSoon, Eren was the last one alive. He shot a laser, but it did nothing. The robot shot its own laser. The laser destroyed Eren's Sword and shattered the Power Stone. A purple sphere formed around Eren. A purple being approached Eren. It reached out its hand. When Eren grabbed it, he stood up. The Purple man was absorbed by Eren. The sphere dissipated, but the results were less than ideal to Eren.\n\n\nAsgard was gone, and all the stars in the night sky no longer shined. Everything in that universe was gone. Eren was devastated. Somehow, he absorbed all power from the Power Stone. He wandered the universe, before making a discovery. All Infinity Swords were intact. The Power Sword was the only damaged one. He found the Time Sword. He broke it in half and grabbed the Time Stone. A Green sphere formed around him. A Green man grabbed Eren and Eren absorbed it, just like with the power stone. He finally had a goal, after all this time. He would wander around the universe and get the power of all 6 Infinity Stones. The last time somebody did this, he almost killed me.\u00a0\n\nAfter thousands of years, he found them all. He now had all the power in the universe, but he couldn't use it. What would he use it for? There's nothing left. Upon realizing this, Eren flew. He had wasted all this time, for nothing. He flew faster. Light speed, 10\u00d7 light speed, 100\u00d7 1,000,000\u00d7. Before he hit something. A giant wall, around the whole universe. He tried to break it, but couldn't. He tried harder and harder, before the wall cracked. He tried harder and it shattered. Eren was flung through the multiverse. He was flying faster than light, but he couldn't move. Eventually he landed in a universe. He found himself on Earth 918 in a US military base. Soldiers surrounded him within seconds.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Put your hands above your head and get on your knees\" said a soldier.\n\n\"You, bossing me? Do you have any idea who I am? I'm an Infinity Warrior.\" Said Eren.\n\nThe soldiers looked around confused.\u00a0\n\n\nEren stood up and walked away, but the soldiers shot at him. The bullets bounced right off his impenetrable skin. Eren stood still. His body started glowing purple. Suddenly, he made an explosion. It knocked the soldiers to the ground, but didn't hurt anyone. The soldiers got up. A tank quickly arrived and shot at Eren. One again, Eren wasn't hurt. He stretched out his hand, which was glowing purple, and suddenly the tank blew up.\u00a0\n\n\n\"FALL BACK!\" Screamed the soldiers commander. Once they left, Eren wandered. He traveled for hours, before something happened. A portal opened. A large, purple man walked out. He had a Vibranium Gauntlet with 6 infinity stones. The stones glowed before the entire planet blew up.\n\n\nAgain, this didn't hurt Eren. But something else did. The being flied towards Eren and punched him so hard that Eren flew past several systems. He landed on a cold\u00a0 gray planet. The being landed on the planet in front of Eren. \"Allow me to introduce myself.\" Said the being. \"I'm Thanos, the Mad Titan. For years, I collected all six of my reality's Infinity Stones, and used them to conquer all. My soldiers told me that someone else landed on the planet with the power of the Infinity Stones, yet didn't carry anything. You are a threat to my power, so I will kill you.\" Thanos charged an attack, but Eren used his own power. Eren glew Blue as he teleported behind Thanos, and glew white as he used an attack that cut Thanos right down the middle. Suddently, all the wounds healed. Thanos was still perfect fine. Eren punched Thanos and knocked his head clean off, but it grew back. \"You amuse me.\" Said Thanos. \"Allow me to teach you about Reality Altering. With the combined power of all six stones, a being can change anything they like about their reality. I used this to make myself invincible. Any wound instantly heals. But Stones can only reality Alter their native reality.\" Thanos fully charged his attack, and shot it at Eren. Eren's stomach was blown right out. He managed to get away before being killed. He found himself on a Neutron Star. The solar radiation kept him hidden from Thanos, and his armies couldn't get close enough to the star to stop Eren.\n\n\nHe used the power of the Time stone to fix the damage. He trained and made a plan for years, before returning. He landed back on Earth. \"Call Thanos.\" He said, using the power of the reality stone to amplify his voice. Thanos arrived shortly. Eren teleported then both back to the deserted planet from before. They engaged in combat. Eren used the power of the Mind stone to make several fake holograms of himself, but Thanos used the Soul stone to get rid of them all. Eren used the power of the time stone to slow Thanos down to 1% his original speed, but Thanos used his own Time stone to undo it. Eren teleported behind Thanos and beheaded him. Of course, Thanos's head grew back. But as it grew back, he couldn't see, hear, or even smell. Eren used this opportunity to bury himself underground. Once Thanos got his senses back, Eren dragged him down and threw him into the planet's core. Thanos used all the stones for an attack that blew up the whole system. Eren teleported them. Both to another deserted planet.\n\n\nEren used the power of all the stones to fire an attack that blew Thanos's hand right off. His hand grew back, yet the Gauntlet is not part of his body so it did not grow back. Eren grabbed Thanos, and dragged him into the multiverse. They flew through it until landing in a fully destroyed reality, Erens native reality. Here, he could Reality Alter. Eren used his power to split all the atoms that makes up Thanos's body. Thanos was killed. Eren returned to the universe. He found the stones. He used the power of the Power stone to destroy the Gauntlet, leaving only the stones. Using the power of the Reality stone, Eren made a sword, one almost identical to the sword of the Infinity Warriors. But this one had 6 slots for stones instead of one. Eren grabbed all 6 stones, and put them all into the sword.\n\n\nThe power of 12 Infinity Stones almost killed Eren, but he used the stones to build himself a set of Armor that absorbed the power Eren could not.

        "I haven\u2019t been to a dentist in 25+ years. It looks like I have a mouth full of kettle corn. Which is why I leave a long mustache and bushy beard. There is no way you\u2019ll ever get me to go to a dentist. Here\u2019s why.\n\nSo, there I am in my bunk and it\u2019s 2:30ish AM. I am chewing gum trying to find peace and then there seems to be a rock in my gum. Only it\u2019s not a rock, it\u2019s a filling. The second the air hit it, I was transported directly to hell. I can\u2019t see, I can\u2019t hear, I don\u2019t know what I am screaming but I keep gasping for breath to let out more screaming. The pain in unbearable. I honestly thought you\u2019re brain had a safety mechanism that would shut you down in extreme cases of pain. Turns out, there is no safety mechanism. \n\nSomehow, I am in a wheel chair being wheeled down a hall. The deputies who are tending to me, two actually give a shit (I am their trustee, their guy) the other wants to knock me out and I can\u2019t blame him. I am screaming like a woman in labor. \n\nI am getting instructions from one deputy, but I am not paying attention. One thing that I do remember was \u201cThis guy is a wrecking ball.\u201d Wrecking ball? I don\u2019t speak enough prison talk to know what a wrecking ball is. I don\u2019t care. I am taken to the infirmary and after a few hours I am given motrin 800. Yep, motrin 800. After a couple hours I am in a dental chair, it\u2019s dark with only one light on my face. The dentist is an older guy, flat top fade, tats, wrinkles, and grunts a lot. Shoves rubber wedges into my mouth and give me one single shot of Novocain. On some people it works, me I need 2 or 3 doses. Within 5 minutes this guy is ready to go to work. My lip isn\u2019t heavy, I still have full sensation, and I politely explain, \u201cDoc, I ain\u2019t numb yet.\u201d Ok, lets see, and he proceeds to work. I grab his wrist, \u201cI am not numb sir.\u201d All I hear is \u201cGet the blanket.\u201d The nurse behind me gets a heavy blanket, looks like a lead blanket for Xrays. Only it\u2019s 3x as big and it\u2019s industrial Velcro. I am wrapped tight in this blanket, then have a leather strap around my chest, waist and legs. They even put one on my forehead to keep me from moving. I am 100% immobilized and can hardly breathe. I beg, plead, cry for mercy and say I am OK, I don\u2019t need anything. Yet nothing is understandable due to the rubber wedges in my mouth. \n\nHe pulls two teeth. I hear them plop onto the metal tray. Ok, now for the second one. Second one? Only one filling fell out. He pulls a second rear tooth that didn\u2019t have any issues. I took it as payback for grabbing his arm. I heard the 2nd plop of my tooth, with roots, covered in blood hit the tray. I am wide awake, feel everything and anything. The nitrous is 2 feet away. The drug cabinet is 6 feet away. Yet, without mercy I am given nothing. After a few minutes I fainted from fear, not pain. \n\nI wake up in the infirmary. My guards are all on duty now, it\u2019s 7AMish. I had to work that day, no restrictions from working. My guards know I seen \u201cDr. Wrecking Ball\u201d (now it made sense) and they tended to me allowing me to lay down on the big couch in their locker room. Even bringing me tea, cookies, fresh gausses, etc. The hard ass walks in and smacks my feet off the couch and says \u201cWTF you doing?!?\u201d Another guard tells him that I went in to see Dr. Wrecking Ball (Dr. Ball). His face showed pity and kindness. He shows me a paper, \u201cI was asked to write you up for forcefully grabbing a deputy. Can you explain this or do you need some time?\u201d I explained that I got a short shot of Novacain and I wasn\u2019t numb and grabbed his arm, then he cuts me off and says, \u201cVelcro blanket?\u201d I nod yes. He asked if he can get me anything, I nod no. He tore the paper in front of me. \n\nThis was 25+ years ago. I have stubs, tiny pieces of teeth left. I constantly get infections where my face swells up, my gums swell up, etc. Yet I refuse to go to a dentist. My primary is telling me that the antibiotics are starting not to work, we keep going up on the strengths and changing meds. The last one, forgot the name but it said to avoid direct sunlight. This was some serious shit. Was in the hospital a few times due to swelling, pain, etc. I was told the infection in the teeth is being swallowed with my spit/food which ends up in my stomache and eventually my blood. I could die from fucked up teeth. A while later I am having issues with my thyroid and glands are constantly swollen. They could not do a routine cyst removal on me due to the infection I had in my blood. It had to be cleared up before I was allowed to be operated on. \n\nI learned to deal with the pains of teeth, the gums tho, oy the gums suck. Getting cysts or bumps inside your gums right below a tooth is enough to drive you to suicide. Yet boiling hot water with a ton of salt, swishing or \u201cpulling\u201d with salt and hot hot water helps a ton. Turns out it might have been a life sentence. \n\nI'd love to run into Dr. Ball and his family when he comes out of church or out of the grocery store. I'd gladly do another sentence. But I learned, if you're going to lay down a beating with a weapon, keep it below the knees and only below the knees. No marks on face, arms, upper body, all below the knees. This keeps it \"Aggravated assault\" and won't go higher than that charge. Trust me, I know.",

Would you like to accompany me to the beverage dispenser in order to stretch our motile appendages?\u201d\n\nHuman Friend O\u2019Leary twitched suddenly at Tcks'kts\u2019 voice but glanced down at him with a strained smile. \u201cSure, Tcks'kts,\u201d he said as his hands flew over the control panel, closing out his program and shutting down his computer.\n\nTcks'kts wondered at that. So far every human he had seen in a professional situation took the time to completely lock down the terminal they were on before they left it even for a short time. The behavior seemed rather unnecessary and wasteful of time, but it was not what had the Trisk concerned today.\n\nThe human finished the task and leaned back in his chair. He indulged in a period of prolonged, slow movement where he extended and contracted symmetrical muscle groups to their full extent before standing. The humans called it stretching, and it seemed necessary to their muscle function. Then the human extended his hand for Tcks'kts to walk out on.\n\n\u201cSo how are you feeling this work cycle?\u201d Tcks'kts asked as he settled himself down on the human\u2019s broad shoulder.\n\n\u201cEh, so-so,\u201d the human said, dipping his shoulders in a sudden shrug.\n\nTcks'kts was very experienced in riding humans, and he compensated for the movement easily enough. It was not the shrug that disturbed him but the human\u2019s response. Humans \u2014 and Human Friend O\u2019Leary in particular \u2014 were notorious for exaggerating their sense of well-being. If he was admitting that some part of his experience was unpleasant, then he was probably experiencing some severe discomfort.\n\n\u201cMay I ask what the positive element of the so-so is?\u201d Tcks'kts asked as they approached the water dispenser.\n\n\u201cThe usual, I guess,\u201d Human Friend O\u2019Leary said with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. \u201cI like all you little guys. I get plenty of human interaction in the other departments. Got an actual physical letter from my buddy Jim back on Terra.\u201d\n\nTcks'kts clicked in sudden delight. \u201cDo you plan on sharing it with the rest of us during the sharing time tonight?\u201d Human Friend O\u2019Leary\u2019s facial muscles gave the tiniest twitch of unease at the question. \u201cOf course the sharing sessions are not mandatory,\u201d Tcks'kts quickly assured him. \u201cIf the letter is too intimate\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Human Friend O\u2019Leary said with a dismissive wave of his hand. \u201cNothing like that. It\u2019s a perfectly un-intimate letter. Mostly reminiscing over old times, you know. We were in a little garage band together as kids. He was on drums.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was the purpose of the band?\u201d Tcks'kts asked curiously.\n\n\u201cWe played music together,\u201d Human Friend O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t all that good, but we had a fun time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds enchanting,\u201d Tcks'kts said with a delighted skitter as Human Friend O\u2019Leary sipped his water.\n\nThe human smiled, and then his eyes drifted to the middle distance, and he sighed. Tcks'kts decided that the subtle approach hadn\u2019t worked and prepared to jump right in.\n\n\u201cIf the letter contained no disturbing information, then why are you so disturbed, Human Friend O\u2019Leary?\u201d Tcks'kts asked as they headed back to the desk.\n\n\u201cSay what?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have been distracted and twitchy all day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeesh,\u201d the human ducked his head and rubbed the back of it uneasily. \u201cThat obvious, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, no problem,\u201d Human Friend O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThe reason why I\u2019m staying home tonight from the sharing session is to get it out of my system.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet what exactly out of your system?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hunger,\u201d Human Friend O\u2019Leary said, his voice deep with earnestness.\n\nTcks'kts mulled this over while they went back to their workstation. \u201cI was under the impression that it was unwise for humans to eat just before going dormant.\u201d\n\nHuman Friend O\u2019Leary laughed and shook his head as he deposited Tcks'kts down at his workstation. \u201cDifferent kind of hunger, lil bud,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in a band. Jim was on the drums, and I was guitar. Some days I just need to play.\u201d His fingers suddenly began the strange twitching pattern they had been attempting to complete all day, and the human hummed out a few notes. \u201cThe music gets in you,\u201d the human went on with a far-off look in his eyes. \u201cIt wants to get out.\u201d\n\nTcks'kts stared at him uneasily, but the human shook himself and grinned down at the Trisk.\n\n\u201cNot to worry, little bud,\u201d he said with a dismissive wave. \u201cI just let myself go too long without breaking out the old six string and giving her a spin. I\u2019ll tune her up and be back to normal by tomorrow.\u201d\n\nTcks'kts idly wondered if \u2018normal\u2019 for a human meant something less confusing than the concepts that Human Friend O\u2019Leary had just expressed.\n\n# [Humans are Weird \u2013 Cravings - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/-AQFrPqaBws)\n\nBook 1 \"[\u200b](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)Humans are Weird: I Have the Data\"\n\n[Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RSVHL81)\n\n[Barnes & Nobe (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/humans-are-weird-adelia-gibadullina/1138927933;jsessionid=CED1CA2DD868CAE60C7F4EAC8FEDD5E5.prodny_store01-atgap01?ean=9781736003923)\n\n[Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=USta%20eBook%20by%20Betty%20Adams%20-%201230004645337%20%7C%20Rakuten%20Kobo%20United%20States)\n\n[Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# [Humans are Weird: We Took A Vote BOOK 2 | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)",
        " The skinwalker in several Native American myths is an individual who has the supernatural power to transform into any animal they choose. Myth occasionally needs the skinwalker to wear a skin of the animal, to be capable of transforming. This skin is not practiced in most instances because in present society as this is a clear indication they are skinwalkers. It is a frequent topic discovered in cultures throughout the world and anthropologists call it shape shifting. Remarkably, these creatures have been seen in many occasions recently. Numerous Native Americans hate the appearance of skinwalkers in popular media since their portrayal could lead them to attack the referring individual. That\u2019s the same reasoning natives wouldn\u2019t want to talk to non-natives regarding the skinwalkers.\u00a0\u00a0 [Read More](https://wixcorn.com/the-skinwalkers-terror/)",

        "\u201cThou shalt not fuck the ballplayers.\u201d\n\nThey made the cheerleaders sign a contract. \n\nI glanced around the room. Bailey looked smug. \n\nWho did you fuck last year? \n\nWhich girl did you tattletale on?\n\nOpening Day was a blur. Every cheerleader was scheduled.\n\nI messed something up.

And part of the things that you were graded for was the Cotilion dance. The grade 9s (aka my grade) were graded for these things. However the grade 10s (my best friend) were graded by the event itself. Since they were the ones who planned and organized it.  \n\nThere were more boys than there were girls with the grade 9s, so we had to pull some of the grade 10s to be our dance partners. And it just so happened I was paired with my best friend. This wasn't a complete coincidence due to the fact that the grade 10s that were in charge of the pairings would often see us together and think of us as together. As a lot of students do when they see two close friends- \n\n\nThe song we danced to, was Perfect by Ed Sheeran. At this point I already liked her so I was REALLY nervous inside.  But it went well. We started at each other's eyes for most of the dance and smiled the whole time. Once it was done, I went back to my seat and just sat there as the dance floor was announced open, and students and their dates going in for a dance. \n\nMy best friend was sort of a \"popular\" girl. I use quotation marks because my school was quite small. So there were a few people who asked her to dance and she accepted to be nice. I had no problem with this because well, we weren't dating. She could do what she wanted. \n\n\nSo I roamed around the event, occasionally saying hi to some of my classmates. My Teacher walked up to me and said \"Hey Tongconator, ask her to dance! (Refering to my best friend) cmon I'll help you I'll be your wingman!\" And despite the offer I said no, and avoided that teacher for the night cause he kept bringing it up- \n\n\nSo I'm sitting at my table again and the DJ announces this will be the final song then the dance floor wouldn't be open to dancing anymore. And what song was it? Perfect. So I was sitting there watching as the students slow danced with their dates on the dance floor, not too bummed that I didn't have a dance partner because I don't like dancing. But then someone blocked my view. It was my best friend with her arm extended down to me. I looked up with her with a smile and a small laugh \"You know I don't like dancing.\" \n\n\n\"I know.\" \n\n\nShe said before making a grabbing gesture with her hand. I rolled my eyes and gave in as I took her hand and she pulled me to the dance floor. \n\nWe're slow dancing to perfect, my hand on her waist and her hand on my shoulder. And I look at her and go \"I hate you. Why would you make me dance\" I say jokingly. She looked at me with a small shrug and a sort of sheepish smile and replied \"Well it's my last year here with everyone. And with you. So I wanted to make it special and memorable.\"\n\nWith that I let out a nervous laugh and followed it up with a sigh before looking over my shoulder to see the teacher who was encouraging me to ask her to dance grinning ear to ear. \n\n\nThe dance ended, and we went to our tables. And there the formal night came to a close. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo that was longer than I thought it would be. Sorry I made you read so much. But this story has been in my head recently despite it being 5 years ago. But thank you for reading my story! If it gets enough reads (which I kinda doubt) I'll post more",
        " When I was a child, I remember being threatened with wildly exaggerated consequences, for refusing to go to sleep. For example, if my father wasn\u2019t aware of the time, he would look down at his watch or likewise, walk over to the kitchen to check the time on the stove, after doing so he would warn \u201cHey Javier, you know what happens to kids who don\u2019t go to bed at\u2026 (glances at watch) at 8:37 p.m.?\u201d he would develop a tale of forewarning, for example, he would say \u201cJavier, if I were you - I\u2019d go to bed. I heard - that if it\u2019s 8:37 - on a weeknight - and you aren\u2019t asleep, the Cucuy will break in through your window, seriously Javier! It happened to me when I was little. Javier, it used to happen so much - that your grandpa had to put bars on the outside of my window to make sure that the viejito couldn\u2019t get to me. Yeah, I don\u2019t know Javier, that\u2019s just what I heard,\u201d as he left, he would always finish his statement with a sharp remark \u201cI thought I would let you know.\u201d Before leaving my room, my dad would shoot short weary glances back and forth between me and the window, which left me fearfully cowering in terror at the thought of some unseen threat. For all I knew, some unknown terror lay outside of my window, watching and waiting - for the opportune moment to break in and scare the living shit out of me, all in some twisted attempt at forcing me to sleep. I reflect on moments like that and it\u2019s no wonder why I\u2019m so fucked up - especially now, as an adult. Oh well, I guess it could\u2019ve been worse, my dad just as well could have taken on the persona of this imaginary character, he could have enacted this ridiculous fantasy all just to teach me a lesson in going to bed at a decent time. I guess the moral of the story is, if your kids don\u2019t want to listen at bedtime, then you can always resort to - alternative methods.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Hi there, I hope everyone enjoys this bit of my childhood; I get a kick out of sharing moments and memories like this with other people. Storytelling has always been really important to me. In fact, it helped me out a lot as a kid to build connections and relationships with others. My goal moving forward is that I would like to start a narration-based podcast. I\u2019d love the opportunity for others to share their own stories with me as well, whether they are fiction or just make-belief. It would be amazing to narrate other individuals\u2019 stories as well. For now, I will continue to share my own. I hope you all enjoy them.",
        "So tonight i had a dream were I was back in my old school but it seemed like I had some kind of zombie virus in me and I was in a basement school-clinic where I was lying on a hospital bed next to my best friends hospital bed who also had that virus or sickness in him. At first it was only about talking to my best friend and about my girlfriend coming in from time to time to check on us. We both had tubes going into our arms that supposedly pumped an antidote into our bloodstreams to keep us from turning, it was like a milky substance, the color kinda like eggnog but a bit brighter. After a while my girlfriend didn't come back and didn't answer to the buzzer over our beds and the antidote also stopped because the tubes clogged up and I couldn't get them to run smoothly again. So at some point I risked it and got up, ripping out the tubes in my arm and telling my best friend to try to get behind his bed without ripping his tubes out in case i started turning. But nothing happened and I stood there kinda baffled and happy about beating the virus or whatever it was so I asked him if he wanted to do the same, and so he did and again nothing happened. Happy but kinda on alert because all this seemed weird we started walking up towards the room of the schools director to tell her the good news but on our way up things got even more weird because we encountered no other students, every door was closed and we didn't hear anything from within the rooms. So we reached the Principles office and knocked on her door but apparently, during my time when I finished school and this incident, they changed the principles office to another room but the strange thing was that while opening the wrong door, every teacher was on it's way out of school while only the principal stayed back in school. So we went to the right door and the principal looked completely surprised to see us but that was understandable given the circumstances. So my best friend was allowed to leave the school with all the other teachers but the principal wanted to talk to me and so we walked through the big room where all the classroom doors went off and she told me that she was very angry and disappointed in me for ripping out those tubes instead of being happy that we were cured. To my surprise she sent me to my old class and it was full of students that looked up to me with fear in their eyes. All the blinds in the room were down and suddenly I heard a mechanical hum which made me walk back down into the big hallway after the principal. As soon as she heard my footsteps she turned around with such anger in her eyes that she kinda scared me so I started smiling to lighten up the mood a bit but that made her even more angry and she screamed at me to go back to the classroom, so I did. Back in the classroom I asked one of the students what was going on with the principal and why they were still in class while all the teachers clearly already left the building but all I got was a weird look I couldn't figure out what it meant so I asked a female student behind me and she started writing something on a piece of paper and signaled me turn back around. I didn't know her but none of the other students seem to acknowledge me being there or even my existence. After a while she slipped the piece of paper in my pocket and it said to move out of the classroom quietly but telling some camera in the corner of the classroom that I'd need to use the restroom. After I left the classroom I hid behind a little walk that separates the auditorium from the second floor classrooms and sat down. After a little while the female student came out and told me to follow her into another classroom that too was full of students that seemed to acknowledge us but ignored us willingly, it all seemed so surreal that its was almost uncomfortable even though I knew I was dreaming. So she lead me to a window in a emergency door that lead to the roof of the locker rooms of the gym and on top of it grew a tree with the number 3 written next to each other 3 times. She started to explain that theres some kind of curse on this school and that the principal puts the school on lockdown every evening and only the teachers were allowed to leave because apparently they weren't affected by it and the reason for my best friend and me being pumped full of that weird fluid. The thing that made me question all that was that my best friend was allowed to leave but I needed to stay so I asked her what was up with that and she answered she didn't know. I asked her if anyone has tried to get to the tree and do something with it but she told me that everyone that tried was either shot by some guards i haven't seen yet or died later on by mysterious circumstances but she'd never seen it by herself but only heard stories about it. This all seemed more and more sketchy so I told her we needed a plan try to figure out what was going on but she was hesitant to help me. I convinced her telling her that if we didn't figure out what was going on that we could possibly just die in here or get as braindead as her fellow students inbthe first classroom so she decided to help me. She told me that there's one door that can be opened that the principal doesn't know about so we went there and climbed up onto the roof with the tree on it and I climbed further up to the roof but she stayed down there. I tried to tell her to try touch the tree but she was too scared at first so I talked her into it for a little bit until she slowly walked towards it, stopped walking for a second and turned around for a second before turning towards the tree again and she touched it. Nothing happened and she started smiling but I told her to go back while I went to confront the principal. So i started making my way down to the principles office. As soon as I was in front of it she sprinted out and gave me a bad punch to the chin. She started yelling what I was thinking and who I think I am to fuck up her plan. She pressed a button on the wall and through the door I saw silver panels going down and as soon as all the windows were covered they started to give away a slight hum and started to shine very bright. All of a sudden many students ran out the classrooms and being chased by other students that went absolutely crazy and started to hit, bite and throw students diwn from the second story. In all that chaos the principal started laughing maniacally so I started running upstairs towards tge emergency exit that was still open and tge principal started chasing after me. On the way up i had to push and punch many students out of my way, under them the girl that initially helped me but now went completely crazy so I had to throw her down to the first floor. On my way out i grabbed a metal handle from a canvas that was used to pull it down from the ceiling. After catching my breath I was hit in the back with something sharp and as I turned around the principal was standing behind me with two big blades in her hand. She started fighting me but I was able to block almost all her blows because she didn't seem to be very goid with the blades and our fight continued outside the building going further and further down the garden onto the road until suddenly she got hit by a car and flew about 60 meters and stayed on the street, facedown, bleeding like hell. I didn't really care about her, i was much more interested in checking myself for injuries. After a few seconds I heard a door from a car and my best friend put his hand on my shoulder asking if I was ok. I told him yes and that he needed to call the police because in the school absolut hell was breaking lose since 15 minutes and I couldn't go back in because I was completely dead from the fight a few minutes ago. So we called the police and they started to lock the school down again and sent a special ops team in to get these panels back up because they believed that they were the reason why so many students started attacking other students. In the end 60 students died from being attacked by other students and 73 attacking students died from heart attacks because their body couldn't handle their rage. Most students saved themselves by barricade themselves into the restrooms.",
        "I'm not someone with the best grip on reality. Had a few episodes in the past but this is a bit weird for the, lingering effect.\n\nSitting under the stars, drinking hot cocoa, I spot a star that seemed, longer than the rest. A streak of light behind it that slowly melded towards the front to make several, triangular shapes. Shifting slightly. \n\nThinking it was nothing more than cold, blurry eyes my attention shifted elsewhere, and I noticed it move in that moment. A different spot in a circluar motion about 5 degrees to the right. This wasn't some sort of disorienting effect on it, for it rested on a different spot along the tree line, further away framed by different branches.\n\nIt continued to shift, growing root like things before sinking back more to a triangular form a minute later. \n\nIt was the cry of a cow that broke my from the star's, Enchanting curiosity. \n\nAt first I thought it was coming from beyond the back gate, and after turning and waiting for more cries, which it did and continues to do so every few moments. I headed through, positive it came from beyond. \n\nNo sooner had I stepped through the gate, walking slightly to the side to listen to the cries, had it just, changed which way it came from. Behind me.\n\nI thought for a moment, about where it could be coming from exactly, and that's when I realized there is simply no place for a cow field where I live now, the surburbs of a city, sprawling streets and houses in every direction. I know this area and there are no cows, but the sound is a cow. I heard them moo often when I lived in more rural parts, and at times make sounds like that when something frightened them. \n\nBut this. This kept at a steady pace of a pained, exhausted voice from one. It is hurt. In pain. I tried again to track the source, finding it came from towards my house now, and as I step through the door I stopped hearing it, doubling back I tried on the house side of the house, the front road, taking care to take another gate from the back to get there as the front is next to another's room.\n\nAgain as I pass the gate nothing, but in the yard again I hear it. A bit frustrated and unsure of what to do I come back in and begin typing this. My room is next to the backyard, and I have my window open,  and I could not hear it, as soon as I walk back out the door however, it is as loud as can be.  \n\n\nAs I have been typing this I have begun to hear what sounds like an elk, and a person.  \n\n\nI cannot stress enough just how small the woods are behind me, not 100 feet on the other side is the other neighborhood, and it does not extend far out in either of the other directions. I don't know where they are coming from.",

A flash of light from a crate, then the hold, then the ship. In a fiery blaze, the ship and its goods fall towards the planet below, scattering like a flock of birds.\u00a0 Few survive, being spread across hundreds of miles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A ping, a signal sent from the ship, received by the few survivors, each thinking they are alone. Far from crew mates, but not alone. The planet is full of creatures,big and small. Few have protection and fewer with the ammo to use it. One survivor gets up on his feet and starts the hike for his life.\u00a0\nThe guard, mystified by the lush jungle, slowly makes his way past the glowing fauna.\u00a0 The jungle lightens up into a grassy, circular clearing with rocks in the middle. He climbs the abyss black rock, noticing a biting cold. Hills in the distance, barren of the thick brush surrounding him. The Guard takes in the sight, then, a flash of light. The lush jungle turns into a barren wasteland of a desert in a blink of an eye.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The guard falls back onto the soft, coarse earth. Not knowing what happened, he checked the tracker. It points in a new direction, showing him closer than before. He recollects himself and searches the horizon in the direction of the signal. A column of smoke rises. He sets off insearch of survivors.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing but footprints leading aimlessly into the arid sands. He continues towards the ship, valuing his life.

A soothing change for the guard.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Walking through the grass, the guard spots a mass of stone, not black with a chill, but warm and earthy. He makes camp for the day. A fire is lit and he remembers that he hasn't eaten in a week. He checks his ammo and stands atop the rock, spotting several like it. The grass rustled.\u00a0 He takes the shot and the creature's movements fall still.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ground beneath him begins to shift. He jumps off the rock as the stones begin to rise with a grind. Creatures of stone, floating joints and a crimson eye. The stone protectors all stare at the guard, each with a red laser tracking him. He runs as the buzz of the charging laser reaches his ear. In the blink of an eye, the red beam thickens, followed by a loud boom and burnt grass. The stone moves sluggishly near. He sprints away, forgetting about his hunger.\u00a0\n     The Guard runs until the Living stone is beyond the horizon. He goes straight towards the ship. He hikes the hill, expecting a crash site miles wide. The only thing was a flattened emergency bunker. His only Hope of getting home, strung across a planet in unknown space.\u00a0",

        "There are rules in prison. Unspoken, unwritten and the only to learn is to go through it or to ask an OG to explain it to you. That OG can mislead you, make you do work, trick you, or he can be a straight up dude and try to put you on the right path for your safety. I was an OG, I know the rules and follow the rules. First night, your first meal. The other inmates are going to take your tray. You\u2019re not getting it back, until you demand it. If you demand it, you\u2019ll get the tray back. But you\u2019ll also get checked later that night (beat up by a few guys). Nothing severe, for some it\u2019s best to ball up and take the 10 or 12 hits/kicks and it\u2019s over. Next meal, you\u2019ll get your tray. If somebody takes something off your tray, it\u2019ll keep happening until you show you\u2019re not to be fucked with.\n\nFirst meal. My tray is taken from me. I stand, I\u2019m 6\u20194\u201d and weigh 340 at the time. I can easily play with 350 on a bench press, I\u2019ve done testosterone injections, dianabol, and a few other roids. I\u2019m big, not bodybuilder but, but not fat. Very politely, very respectfully, \u201cI would like my tray back. Please.\u201d I got my tray, then asked who wanted it, nobody spoke up, so I tossed it in the trash. I knew I was going to fight that night. So, after count, I get jumped by 4 White guys, and I fought like a demon. Fucked two up, the other two fucked me up. Next night? Same thing. Then their leader stood up, \u201cLet him eat in peace, he proved himself.\u201d\n\nI was in Corcoran state penitentiary. I do not have a set or a car or a gang to roll with. Your car, your set is who backs you up, who you ride with. If they fight, you fight. If they riot, you riot. It\u2019s your family basically. Now it\u2019s divided and it is very weird, but I\u2019ll try to explain it to you.\n\nThe Wood Pile: All White. Racist. Swasticas. Tats. Hate everybody yet will associate with you a little, but they are not to be trusted, ever.\n\nThe Blacks: No explanation needed. They\u2019ll be cool with you, if you show respect.\n\nThe South Siders: These are your L.A. tattoo face Mexicans. You do not mess with these guys. Don\u2019t play ball with them, don\u2019t joke, don\u2019t make cracks, just say no.\n\nThe Paisa (Pie-sa): Think Mexican Cowboy. The Mexican in the cowboy hat, pointy toe boots, plaid shirt, singing and yelling \u201cEye eye ha!\u201d. These Mexicans DO NOT get along with the South Siders. Why? Never asked. Was too afraid to get into it.\n\nThe Gays: One rule. Be gay. Now these guys are cool, friendly and will gladly speak to you and befriend you. They will not rape you unless you ask. Which I\u2019ve seen it happen. They\u2019ll dye your hair, they\u2019ll shave you, haircut, will help in any way. Yet mess with one, and \u2026. Let\u2019s just say don\u2019t mess with them.\n\nThe Others: You don\u2019t fit into any category listed above. Asian, Arab, Jew, Islander, etc. This is the lowest of the cars you could ride in. Nobody will really stick up for you because we simply don\u2019t have the numbers. I am a Russian Gypsy, and I am NOT racist. Whites threw me out instantly when they heard Gypsy. Got a lot of Hitler shit thrown in my face, but I let it slide.\n\nNow, there is a group of Christians, but it\u2019s not a car. Yet. A few guys get together and read the Bible and have Bible study once per week and it\u2019s run by an old man who quite honestly doesn\u2019t know enough to be running a Bible study, to answer questions properly, etc. Me? I am a devout Christian (yes, a bad Christian, we\u2019re all bad, there is no Good Christian). I politely asked if I can take over one night, guys were into it and now, we have prayer circle each and every night along with Bible study and 30 to 60 minutes of Q&A about what we studied OR about the Bible or etc. Slowly, this turned into \u201cThe Christian Car\u201d and I am running it. We\u2019ve got a Gays, Blacks, Whites, everybody. We\u2019re not officially a car, but we are.\n\nI would go to the leader of each crew and ask permission to speak to the leader. This was always done with my shirt off to show I got no tats, don\u2019t roll with anybody, not looking to put in work, etc. I would very politely, very respectfully ask that leader, \u201cMay I ask a few of your people if they\u2019d like to participate in prayer circle and Bible study? It would help a lot if you came too.\u201d They always declined to join, but I was allowed to announce prayer circle, study, etc. When I got a few people pissed, the leader would yell out, \u201cChill! He\u2019s asking you. Say yes and go or say no and sit in your bunk.\u201d A few would come. And this went on every night. I\u2019d always ask permission, always granted and then a few leaders joined our group. I even passed out prayer lists, I asked if I can pass a book around so people can place the names of people to pray for and what was needed/asked for them and I explained that, \u201cWe will simply mention their names in prayer, not going into detail. The details will be prayed over in my private time with the specifics.\u201d This got me more people, and even leaders put down names of family members, kids, etc. I basically got the leaders to open up to me, allowing to see a weaker side. I took advantage of this in my own way. Getting them alone, talking to them about their requests, asking how is the family and this got me sort of a therapist reputation, along with \u201cCan I be forgiven? Will He forgive me?\u201d And I\u2019d get into some deep heavy conversations where they\u2019d let their guard down. Again, this is a huge advantage for me. Was it done spiritually? Technically, but I seen a way that this information can be helpful if it\u2019s ever needed.\n\nI am always getting questions, always being asked for advice, always doing my best to lead them with the correct answers. I never ask people to put in work. Never asked who is dealing, what is the price of this, that, etc. No judgement. No interference from me at all.\n\nOne day a kid comes in. 19, clean cut, handsome. But you can tell all this guy knows is women, no street smarts at all. He was in for \u201cAttempted bank robbery with a note.\u201d Yet he had a gun in the car, but no ammo. I see this kid hasn\u2019t eaten in a few days and then I come sit next to him. Now, being somewhat of a pastor/preacher, I have the freedom to sit at any table, so long as I ask permission. This is a big thing in prison. I sat with the kid, asked if he has money on his books and tried to give him my muffin (no, not my ass, an actual muffin) which somebody immediately took from him. I didn\u2019t say shit. I called him over to my bunk and got him a soup and some candy which he inhaled. I nearly cried. I explained that \u201cIf you want to eat, you have to demand your tray, then take the beating. And you got to fight back a little. Don\u2019t let them abuse you, just show you got a pair.\u201d The kid cries, said he was never in a fight in his life. Don\u2019t even know how to throw a punch. Well, you\u2019re in the NFL now rookie and you\u2019re gonna have to learn to take a hit. But hit back. Don\u2019t just fall otherwise you\u2019ll become somebody\u2019s bitch. I asked if he was gay and he immediately said \u201cNo way man.\u201d I chuckled, \u201cNeither are these guys, but a warm moist hole is a warm moist hole.\u201d\n\nNext day I fed him well. Told him to demand his tray and to be prepared for the beating later that night. He did and he got beaten, he threw a few shitty punches but he tried, I\u2019ll give him that. Next night, they did it again. I went over to the leader of the Wood Pile and asked if there was something he can do, he\u2019s just a kid. Dead eye tells me \u201cHe belongs to us. He is one of us. He\u2019ll learn.\u201d I know the kid is fucked.\n\nThe information I am sharing with him could get me killed, but I took a liking to this kid and his innocence and lack of wisdom. I told him at some point somebody is going to ask you to hold something or deliver something. It could be a trap or it could be your way in, that is totally you call. But if you say no, you\u2019re sort of fucked either way. You\u2019ll catch another beating but never ever rat. Just say you fell. Time passes, he\u2019s in Bible study every night, asking me questions, begging for help, and there isn\u2019t much I can do. It\u2019s the fucking Wood Pile. One night he was asked to hold a shiv, which he immediately drops and says NO! It fell to the ground, another picked it up and man did he get whipped. I had no choice but to watch. This kids life is going to get ruined with another case or he is gonna get killed, raped, and end up doing 15+ if not more.\n\nHe gets out of the infirmary. Never said a word. Then a giant of a man, think Yokozuna from WWF, a huge Islander says, \u201cWe need to protect that kid. We need to get him out of that set fast. Who\u2019s with me?\u201d Now, am not one to back out of a fight, but this is potential war with the Wood Pile. Skin Heads. Yet, a few of them are in study every night. This has me worried as fuck, word gets out, we\u2019re all going to get stabbed one bye one. The Whites in our group are high ranking, so they spoke up. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what we can do. We\u2019ll do our best.\u201d Turns out they want work to be done by the Christians, who don\u2019t do \u201cWork\u201d. Beatings, smuggling, theft, etc. We\u2019re as peaceful as possible. The work they want is deliveries made, packages accepted until the leader feels the price was paid. This is potential disaster. It could go on for months, could get us more time or it\u2019s a straight setup.\n\nAn Arab (who isn\u2019t Christian, yet prays with us every night), the huge Islander, a few of the Gays (called Gay Boy Gangsters) the rat hunters (lowest of lows, every group is in there and all they do is seek rats and do what needs to be done). A small uprising is starting because I took a liking to this kid and would openly pray for him. Fifteen guys approach the leader of the Wood Pile, not asking, but demanding that this kid is set free and he belongs to us. We\u2019re 50 guys strong. We\u2019ve got a few elite guys with us, shot callers, bosses, leaders. I am looked at and told, \u201cYou know you\u2019re going to have to pay, in some way. I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d Later that night, before Bible study I yell out, \u201cSee what you motherfuckers got me into!?!I was giving advice, you guys went for action and who\u2019s it on? ME! NOT YOU! ME!\u201d Study, Q&A was stopped for a few days. I was scared shitless.\n\nNow, a street fight, toe to toe is one thing. 2 or 3 guys? Hey, I can take a hit. But the martial arts, boxing, street fights won\u2019t help you in a prison fight. Think of somebody with a shiv, he isn\u2019t going to pick it up near his head and stab, I\u2019d be 100% prepared for that and can counter it easily. This is waist high, hidden shiv, then an upward jab, from belt high to ribs. It\u2019s hard to block, hard to read, and I was never prepared for that sort of attack. I can\u2019t think straight.\n\nI approach the leader who I have somewhat of a relationship with. I used his personal information (his prayer list against him). Know how you pray for your sons, your daughters, how they don\u2019t end up like you? Somebody is praying for this kid, it\u2019s somebody\u2019s kid, somebody\u2019s baby boy. You can tell this isn\u2019t a street wise guy who has a background. This kid needed money and tried to rob a bank with a note. I know who you are and more importantly what you are, and I know who/what I am. Please, let that dad instinct kick in. Leave him alone. He\u2019s only doing 5, don\u2019t make him come out a monster.\n\nBible study resumes that night. I am told to read Exodus Chapter 31 about how God was going to kill all the Israelites because they made a golden calf. God told Moses, \u201cWait here, while I kill them all.\u201d Then Moses prayed to God saying, \u201cHave mercy on them, for they do not know what they are doing. Show them mercy.\u201d Then God said, \u201cGo to your people. Ask who chooses me and who chooses the golden calf as their god.\u201d And at the end, I explained to the group that although God may be angry with you, a simple prayer could change his mind. A simple respectful request could turn God\u2019s anger and wrath into love and admiration. The leader of the Wood Pile was in the group that night.\n\nHe came to me and said, \u201cDon\u2019t take this as a sign of weakness. I am going to let you take the kid. But if he ever fucks up, if he ever disrespects the Wood Pile, his ass is ours.\u201d I thanked him, gave him a firm handshake and then he said, \u201cThere is a red light on your car from the Wood Pile. Anybody tries to get any of you to put in work or screws with you. We\u2019ve got your back. Keep it up. Turn one life around.\u201d Immediately I went back to our group and let the word out but I demanded no celebrating no cheering and a few went to thank the leader. No words, no gifts, just a nod and firm handshake.\n\nOn that night, the leader of the Blacks who was with us from the beginning and the few high ranking Gays also talked to their leaders explaining what we do, how we don\u2019t judge or discriminate, how we treat them, etc. We had a \u201cRed Light\u201d placed on us from Wood Pile, Blacks, Gays, Rat Hunters and the Paisas who fear God and God only. Only one who didn\u2019t give or offer a red light was the South Siders. We didn\u2019t ask, yet we had a few.\n\nThe majority of the Christian car runs the kitchen and are custodians for the guards. Not custodian as in janitor cleaning toilets of inmates, but the upkeep of the guards locker rooms, washing the cars, doing errands for the Deputies. We\u2019ve got the Deputies on our side as well. A few times we witnessed some shit that went down, yet we kept our mouths shut. The main Deputy asks me for some intel and while we\u2019re cool, I simply said, \u201cI know nothing about what you\u2019re speaking of, sir.\u201d He\u2019d press me a little bit, but we both knew if I talked, it could mean my life.\n\nI did six of ten years. Good behavior, trustee, Bible study, zero write ups, participating in scared straight program as a regular. That was fun as shit. The other inmates would loose their shit and go ballistic, where I took the calm approach. \u201cThis is a zoo. We are wild animals. You are bunny rabbits. Sure, you might be a bad bunny out in school, but you\u2019ll never make it in here. I don\u2019t see no potential in none of you to become one of us. There are predators, me, and there is prey, yous. I get laid all the time. I get sex, get my room cleaned, I got several bitches. Keep it up, you might end up being my bitch. Know those punk ass kids that run home 15 minutes before they supposed to be home? Know that kid that gets good grades? Those punk bitches?\u201d They all laughed. \u201cWell, they\u2019re out free right now, eating, drinking, going out, doing family shit. While us bad motherfuckers, us gangsters are all in here. So, keep it up, you can enjoy your life or you can be a bitch here.\u201d I got through to a few of those kids where the yelling and screaming didn\u2019t work nearly as well.\n\nTwo years later? I was back in. I was forced into a \u201cjob\u201d I didn\u2019t want to take because we didn\u2019t have the proper intel. But I beat it. It was my 2nd strike.\n\nGot a lot more weird stories. Some involve true love. Some involve serious violence. While some go deep into corruption and bribery. Been to countless therapists. Seen many shrinks. Been on dozens of medications. Because of the shit I\u2019ve done, shit I seen and shit I was involved in. In the end, gray hair is a sign of wisdom. I shouldn\u2019t be alive to have gray hair. If I could have, I would have taken the nerd way out, hit the books and get an education and a shitty job with a mortgage and up to my eyes in debt. But I choose to be a criminal. I paid my debt to society and am still paying for it. I can be at a party, be out with friends, then a past demon will remind me of this or that and I\u2019ll have a panic attack where I have to go find some alone time and maybe cry it out a little.\n\nI might continue getting shit off my chest with these. Somehow it helps a lot more writing about it, then explaining it to some guy on a couch who will tell me some bull shit exersize with breathing and go to my private place and think happy thoughts. Fuck him and fuck his happy thoughts. The good times were great, but the bad times, fuck me they were bad. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve got most of my demons locked away in cages. They bark, they make a little noise, but they know their place. But there is a few who follow me and keep me awake at night where I seek the comfort of a joint, a few shots of cheap whiskey or a furious masturbation session. But they come back.\n\nEDIT: A lot of people asked why was I in prison. Here is the ugly truth. My then girlfriend cheated on me. I took a 10\" chef's knife and proceeded to the bedroom. With her screaming, covering herself as best she could, I removed the tags on the mattress and pillows that says, \"Do not remove under Federal Law.\" Turns out they weren't kidding with that warning. \n\nNO! That's a joke from PeeWee Herman's first movie. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. A chop shop which I was involved in, which I rarely went to, turns out I had to go to correct a few people who were \"Skimming\". A part of me held them responsible for a few years, but I had time to reflect. Had I NOT been a part of the chop shop, had I not been so tight on my books and let the workers skim a few bucks here and there, I wouldn't have got arrested. I released my anger and hatred toward them. ",
        "(Romance, slightly Halloween-themed, SFW)\n\n\"Look,\" said the witch, leaning back against a cabinet and absentmindedly twirling her long spoon.  \"Of course I know what kind of charm you want.  What I'm telling you is you can't have it.\"\n\n\"But ... it's the whole reason I came here!\" Meg was practically crying.\n\n\"Aw,\" the witch replied with a smirk, \"and here I was hoping it might be because you wanted to see your childhood friend.\"\n\n\"Well, it is,\" Meg said.  Or, it's that too, at least... uh. Theora look, you said no questions but why can't I?\"\n\nThe witch's mouth opened and closed several times, forming words that had no sound, and then she closed her mouth into a straight, firm line.  \"Because I care about you, Meg, and you can't get what you want with a charm like that.  And my name is Athelia now.  That kind of love charm is evil.  You slip a potion into his drink or his food or whatever, he drinks and falls madly, completely, hopelessly in love with you, and then what?  You think that's going to make you a happy couple?\"\n\n\"Well...  why wouldn't it?\" Meg asked.\n\nAthelia's mouth compressed into a thin line again, and a look of real pain crossed her face.  Finally, with a visible effort, she choked out, \"Because you won't love him!  You may think you love him now but you don't! Not if you're willing to do that to him!\"  Then she gasped for breath.  \"Damn it, Meg, there's a reason I said don't ask questions!  That hurts!\"\n\n\"What ... um.\" Meg trailed off awkwardly.\n\n\"Look, Meg....  I'm under guild sanction.  I ... I messed up during my training, okay? And tried to cast exactly that kind of charm.  I was very lucky, because I was too far away and it didn't work.  But the guild found out.  I tried to trick someone with magic, and they Named me to make sure I never do it again.  I am Athelia now.  It means Truth-speaker.  I can't trick anyone, ever.  I can\u2019t lie to anyone, ever.  When someone asks me a question, I have to tell them the truth,  and the longer it takes me to tell them, the more it hurts.  So out of respect for yourself, please don't ask questions about things you don't really want to know.  And out of respect for me, please don't ask questions about something I might not want to tell you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Theora, that's horrible!\" Meg cried. \"You... you couldn't ever be anywhere near a child, could ... damn it!\"\n\nThe witch hung her head.  \"My name - the name my soul is bound to - is Athelia now.  I had another name once but I can't even say it any more.  You and I might be the only two who even remember it.\" A tear dripped from her dark face onto her white apron.\n\nA long moment of silence passed.  Finally Meg said, \"Athelia, do you... um. I mean. Uh.  I'd like to give you a hug, if you'd allow it.\"\n\nThe witch looked up, startled.  It was the kind of look a wild animal gives in that moment of panic as it realizes you've already seen it, before it turns to bound away.  Then, slowly, she relaxed.  \"I ... I think I'd like that. If you're willing.\"\n\nMeg got up and took two steps across the floor of the tiny caravan, and folded Athelia into her arms.  \"So you messed up once.  And your guild is ... uh, harsh, if you don't mind me sayin'.  I'm not gonna start hating you for that,\" she said. After a pause she furrowed her brow. \"So who were you trying.... \" She caught herself as she felt Athelia\u2019s body stiffen in alarm.  \"You know what, maybe I shouldn't talk at all.\"\n\nThey stood like that for a long, quiet minute before Athelia broke the embrace, put her spoon back in the soup-pot on her tiny wood stove,  and quietly sat down on her bed.\n\n\"It's not a bad life, Meg.  There's no need to be sorry for me.  I have this nice little one-room cottage, and I don't own land but it's on wheels so I don't need to.  I may be new to spellcraft but I'm actually pretty good at it.  A good witch can find work all over, and if I want to I'll see lots of faraway places in time. And if our guild is harsh sometimes, that helps keep me safe.  Nobody would dream of attacking a wagon with this guild seal painted on the side.  So I can go anywhere, even the places where people need the most help.  And I can help them.  I mean, really help them.  Sometimes I can even give them what they need instead of what they want.  So maybe I'm in the guild under a sanction.  That's okay. It's still a good life.\"\n\n\"But it sounds like a lonely one,\" Meg said. \"Doesn't leave much room for a man, does .... oh crap, how do you even... no.  Ugh!  I can't even talk like this!\"\n\nAthelia gave her a smile.  \"But it's adorable to see you try so hard.\"\n\nMeg sat down in the chair facing the witch again.  \"So,\" she said carefully.  \"I am going to ask a question.  Not a sensitive one I hope but it's about love charms.\"  She waited a moment for Athelia to nod.  \"Is there some kind of charm that would, if they're willing and I'm willing - and I am for sure \u2013 let me and my crush both wind up in love and without dark secrets and betrayals to spoil it?\"\n\nAthelia nodded slowly.  \"There's a potion I can brew.   It takes a long time and I don't often have access to all the ingredients.  But all the couple have to do is both know what it is, both genuinely want it to work, keep passing the cup back and forth, and drink it one swallow at a time.  Very popular with older married couples.   And there's a charm I can make. They're easy for me, but harder for the couple.  They each start wearing a paper tag the other's pinned to their clothes every day.  There's a bit of fancy rune work and a few side effects, but basically hers says  'I love him,' his says 'I love her', and if they wear them every day, then by the end of the month it's true.  That\u2019s mostly kids right out of school who are just friends but their folks insist on them getting married.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" said Meg.  \"There's no chance of keeping that second one secret, is there? ...Ack! I'm sorry!\"\n\nAthelia shook her head.  \"None at all,\" she replied evenly.  \"But there never was, Meg.   If someone asks me what potions I've brewed or what charms I've made or even who I've made them for, then I have to tell them.  I abused secrecy, so now I'm not allowed any.\"\n\n\"Ugh.\" Meg said. \"That sounds like it would put a real damper on any business in love charms.\"\n\nAthelia shrugged.  \"Not so much,\" she replied.  \"There's wheels under this little cottage after all.  I'll be in another town  tomorrow, another county in a week, maybe another kingdom a month from now.  It\u2019ll be years, or maybe never, before anybody they care about gets a chance to ask me about their secrets.  Just depends on where the Guild sends me.\"\n\n\"You came back home... but you're going again,\" Meg said.  \"I guess I knew that.  It was one thing when you went off for your apprenticeship, but ... I really hate to say goodbye to you and think it may be forever.\"\n\n\"Did I, Meg?  Did ... who I was before, really come back home?  It doesn't feel like home here any more.  My life now doesn't feel like the same life.  Nobody but you even remembers that little slip of a girl who disappeared seven years ago.  There's someone else living where my family was.  Where my dad worked, there's a bakery now.  This ... might have been her home.  That other me, the one whose name I can't say, if she'd stayed.  But she didn't, and this is not my home.  I doubt if I'm ever coming back again.\"  \n\nThe witch lay back across her bed, staring at the ceiling, appalled at how heartless her words must sound. She couldn't lie anymore, so she couldn't console Meg with hopes and platitudes. But she could offer something. She didn't really want to, but she owed Meg that much.  \"Um.  So Meg, do you really want a love charm?  Knowing how they really work?  'Cause... I'll do one free for you. Kind of like, 'fare well,' you know, except with a bit of magic to help make the faring well really happen.\"\n\nMeg turned on the edge of the bed and stared down at her.  This was, and wasn't, Theora.  Her soul was different.  Not broken, not stunted, not even damaged.  Just different.  Older, wiser.  Maybe a little bit sadder.  But still as bold and as strong as Theora had always been.  Theora had been a child.  Athelia wasn't.  All the same.... \"Yes,\" she said.  \"I think I do.\"\n\nAthelia nodded, got out her papers, then from a little cabinet with half a hundred tiny drawers, she took out a bottle of ink, a tiny charcoal stick, and a pen made completely of glass.  She started with the charcoal stick. scritch-scritch on the ribbon, as runes and patterns and swooping lines emerged.  \"The runes here,\" Athelia mumbled.  \"This is your name.  It says, I love Meg, and all this fancy linework is ... it sort of fuses the paper and reality together, right?  Let me adjust this line a little here....  and ....  ready.\"  \n\nMeg stood silently watching the whole procedure.  Athelia put the charcoal stick away, then pressed the paper down against another.  \"Mirror image, so he\u2019ll read it every time he sees his reflection.\"  She lifted away the charcoal strip, leaving a ghostly mirror image outline on the other, and started carefully tracing it in strange, difficult, sticky ink that wouldn't stay the same color for more than a heartbeat or two and seemed to flow like honey.  A half-hour later she set it down.  \"Good to go as soon as the ink dries,\" she said cheerfully.  \"Now to do the other one, the one you'll be wearing.  What's the name of this lucky mystery man you're pursuing?\"\n\n\"Um, actually,\" Meg said, \"I think her name's Athelia.  See, I came here tonight to ask you a really important question but before I got my nerve up to it, you told me no questions. And then I found out you wouldn't have had any real choice about answering it so...\"\n\nThe witch stared at her old friend in blank astonishment for a few moments, then her face seemed to melt.  Her arms went around Meg tightly and she began to cry.  \"I swear,\" she said, \"I swear they told me it failed, or I'd have dropped everything and come straight to you!  Dear God, I'm so sorry!  What I did to you...\"\n\n\"Wait, what?\"  Meg finally realized what she was talking about.  \"It was me?  Me you tried to ... Oh, that's rich.\"\n\n\"Yes it was you!\" Athelia cut in.  \"But  Go on, I want you to finish!\"\n\n\"You didn't do this to me with magic,\" Meg said urgently.  \"and I'm not even a little bit mad at you for trying.  You couldn't have possibly done this because I was head over heels for you before you even left.  No charm like that could have worked, 'cause there was nothing for it to do. \"  \n\n\"They never actually said why it failed,\" said Athelia. \"I thought it was because you were too far away.  I just.... I didn't want you to forget me.  It was ... training was hard, and lonely, and I missed you and I hadn't seen you in so long.... I was thinking of running away and coming back to you but I was terrified that I'd get here and you wouldn't care.\"\n\nMeg nodded.  \"I should have said something when you left but I didn't.  I just ... I told myself it was because I didn't want to hold you back, and I told myself I\u2019d get over you, I told myself I didn\u2019t want to ruin our friendship, but ... all that was bullshit.  I was just too big a coward. Too big a coward to admit I liked girls.  Too wound up about how weird it was to think maybe you might too.  Too big a coward ... You know, I've never told anyone at all, until just now.\"\n\n\"I ... I don't know what to say,\" Athelia said.  \"All this time ... why now?\"\n\n\"Oh, all the reasons,\" said Meg.  \"It never stopped being true, and it might be the last chance ever.  And you're going to need some company to keep you from being lonely on the road, and you're going to need a helper who can ... choose how much to tell folks.\u201c\n\nShe paused, then went on. \u201dAnd if you have no choice about telling the truth, then I'd feel pretty awful if I refused to tell it to you.   You're actually facing the world without any choice about what to say and when to keep silent, and that's what you call 'not a bad life.'  I've been held back by little fears about stuff that doesn't matter, but you're showing me what courage is. You're setting about living life under a condition that would have most people paralyzed with fear and your biggest hope is about finding ways to do good in that life.  That's ... that's an inspiration. So... Damn it, do we even need these ribbons?\"\n\n\"Probably not but I'm going to finish this one anyway,\" Athelia cut in, with a manic grin. \"Because just wait until you get a load of the side effects first time we pin them on each other.  You'll like them.  You'll like them a lot, I swear.  They're kind of awful for people who have to keep their hands off each other but from this night forward we are definitely not those people!\"",
        "It was lunchtime, my friends and I were playing truth or dare. When we finished, I suddenly remembered that story when the twins in my old class kissed for a dare. I told them about it and asked if they thought it was weird. I received the general 'yes' except my boy best friend who said 'No.'\n\n\"They're siblings, so it's fine.\"  -was his reason.\n\nI was about to ask him to elaborate further when I realized I accidentally left out one *tiny* detail.\n\n\"What if they were both guys?\"\n\n\"THEY WHAT?!\"\n\n(Alright, so, just to be clear, if anyone ever finds this offensive in some way, I apologize. I mean no harm -I just wanted to share)",

They were twined together in a shallow pool that formed a sort of raised center to the common room of the research base. The main lights had been dimmed in tune with the diurnal cycle of the planet, and the majority of the staff were spending the rest day sprawled over the furniture either reading or composing messages for distant loved ones. Several human couches were arranged around the Undulates\u2019 pool, all facing the circular stone contrivance the humans called the fire pit. A vent hovered over the pit to guide the fumes and smoke out of the common area, and various steel levers hung on the side for when the humans felt the mysterious urge to prod at the flames.\n\nTwistunder\u2019s musings were cut short as one of the humans in the shadowy reaches of the room tossed aside his book and directed a resentful glare at the large bay of windows that comprised the south arc of the structure. Twistunder mused over the view. One of the massive storms, the kind that were unheard of on his planet, was whipping the forest outside into a frenzy of movement. The trees, each of which he knew to be several unds in diameter, were bending and dipping like so much algae. Twistunder supposed he could sympathize with the frustration that caused the human to drum his fingers on the arm of his chair. Finally the human produced a wordless gust of air and snapped to his feet.

        "So this happened about my Junior year. I was a well known student amongst many others in my  \u201cgroup\u201d. I had a new student in my biology class and he didn\u2019t seem to know where he was going. So of course, I helped him out. I invited him to have lunch with my group, and after he invited me to his house for homework. The only class we had together was biology and we didn\u2019t have homework that day either. Now me being me, I didn\u2019t think anything of it, so I went.\n\nWhen I got to his house he said he was home alone and to just welcome myself in. Doing so, as I opened the door, I was greeted by a little girl. I was hesitant, remembering he said he was home alone, but just waved and walked past her. When I stepped inside I got a cold and uneasy feeling, but I just shook it off. Keep in mind I wasn\u2019t too fond of paranormal stuff at the time. \n\nAs I got to his room he was just kinda sitting there. No expression of any sort. Just sitting there. Assuming he was dozing off, I took a seat in front of him and pulled out our books. He was still dozed. I asked him if he was alright and sat for a good 5 minutes without a response. At this point I was fed up and I thought he was just messing around, so I gathered my things and said I was gonna leave. As I got up to leave and head for the door, I noticed it was locked. I only shut the door behind me and went straight to his room. The only person in this house besides me was the boy and the little girl. The little girl could only reach the knob lock, the other lock was a sliding lock sitting higher up on the door. And it couldn\u2019t have been the boy either because he was just sitting there, and I was watching him the entire time. \n\nI hurried out of his house and looked back. All was still the same but I noticed the little girl looking through one of the second story windows.. It was the same expression as her (i\u2019m assuming) brother\u2019s. Just blank. \n\nThe next day at school he wasn\u2019t there, followed by the rest of the year. I never heard from him since..",
        "That one girl everybody hated\n\nYou know the one, the obnoxious loud girl in school with no social awareness\n\nThe one who talked too much\n\nWho joined circles of people that didn\u2019t want her and said awkward things\n\nThe girl who got mean notes in her locker and then got the whole school in trouble for it\n\nThat girl was me.\n\nAs an adult I was driven to be successful, but more than anything, I wanted to be hot. \n\nAt age 25 I got a nose job.

        "African Airspace, 2023:\n\n\nTwas less than a week before Halloween, but this matter was crucial to the conflict. A taskforce comprised of UNSC, Collective, and Hellish troops engaged a large scale aerial battle over the African Coast against a large fleet of Covenant ships. Banshee's and MiG's duked it out, shooting each other down. Onboard a Covenant capital ship, Ashlyn, Verosika, Zoe, and three dozen 501st clones engaged a security detail, attempting to capture a High Prophet, one of the rulers of the Covenant. Ashlyn and co stormed the ship, gunning down dozens of Sangheili and Kig-Yar. The bridge doors were blown open, the heroes bursting in. Resistance was small, as the only Covenant troops in the room that weren't dead were simple navigation crew. Zoe looked around, sighing in annoyance at the sight of their target, the corpse in fact. She looked around, glancing at dead Honor Guards and slain Commandos, asking,\" What the fuck happened?... \" Ashlyn replied,\" These wounds are from a Sangheili energy sword, so the prophet was killed by one of their own. This makes no sense! Why would a Sangheili do this!? Are we dealing with a power hungry psycho?!\" A sangheili warrior appears and blows a hole in the wall, trying to kill the heroes. Ashlyn turns around and shoots the elite in the neck, killing him. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the hangar, three clones stood guard, managing the surrendering crew and seeing them out via shuttles. One clone noticed a blinking light, and in a flash, shot his brothers dead. A group of Mandalorians and elites walked out, guarding a handcuffed Zealot. The clone called for a shuttle, which arrived. The group boarded the craft and placed their asset into the most secure compartment. The clone piloted the vehicle out and called for two ships to follow them. A human mercenary sat in the cargo hold, glaring down at a nervous Sangheili. The elite asked,\" What happens now?\" A Mandalorian replied,\" That's not your concern... \" before shooting the elite in the head. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCairo:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How much for these two fruits?\" The elite asked. The vendor replied,\" 3 dollars, you've been a good customer for a year, Rala.\" Rala nods and hands the vendor his money before taking the fruit. The Sangheili wore navy blue commander armor, but no one really cared if a 7 foot monster stood around, to them, he was just a shy fellow. As he walked, Rala looked around, his training and skills put to use, trying to spot potential ruffians. In case of trouble, Rala kept a Plasma Rifle strapped to his thigh. For a year, Rala hid among the sands of Egypt, as he was a former Collective liaison to the Covenant. He didn't bother anyone, but he wondered if it was really their disinterest in him, or primal fear of seeing a Sangheili. Whatever the reason was, Rala hadn't killed a person in 9 months, not since a mugger attempted to rob a woman on the street. Through a bit of intellectual conversation, quick thinking, and probably a lack of interest by the other party, Rala was allowed to walk free. During this period, Rala created a makeshift lair inside an old palace. Many locals saw the Sangheili as a brave, yet shy creature who'd rather stay inside a haunted palace, as compared to living in a homeless shelter. Rala turned on his tablet and watched YouTube, only to hear a creaking sound. Annoyed, he grabs his shotgun and walks out. Rala comes face to face with a man aiming a gun at him. Rala lowered his gun, saying,\" Who the fuck are you?\" The man says,\" A friend, don't worry, I'm not here to kill you.\" Rala finds the man strangely attractive, and says,\" You know, I know quite a bit about you, all except your name, Mister..?\" The man replies, \" Bond, James Bond. I've never encountered a make like you. Shall we, wow this feels almost wrong, entertain ourselves? \" Rala stammers for a second, stating,\" I know you're used to girls, but I've been lacking in romance for years. Might as well kill two birds with one stone.\" Bond replies,\" I mean if you want, we can, however I'm not used to this.\" Rala shows Bond his surprisingly luxurious bed. The pair begin making out, Bond confused, and yet, still willing to make love to this creature. Rala says,\" Mister Bond, you've practiced, haven't you...\" Bond replies, \" Constantly. \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLondon:\n\n\n\nMallory blurts out,\" 007, what the fuck is that...?\" Bond replies,\" This is Rala Latamai.\" M groans and says,\" Oh, you brought a goddamn asset into HQ... \" Rala smirks and says,\" Nice to see that the British Secret Service is still as good as the old days. \" M says,\" What was the point, Bond? Is he a target? An asset?\" Bond replies, \" Well, sir. Several strange events occurred near the North part of Africa. One of our operatives found his name listed on a hit list, so I'm keeping an eye on him.\" M replies,\" I know who's been hiring killers and mercenaries. The criminal underworld calls him The Didact's Hand. We don't know his real name, but he's a Sangheili warlord.\" Bond replies,\" Jul M'Dama? Isn't he wanted for the Turkish ambassador murder?\" M says,\" Are you saying that Jul M'Dama is after an informant? \" Bond replies, \" Yes, sir. However we have his location, Greece. \" M says, \" Then get on it. Oh, and make sure you find out if he's involved in art smuggling, we've got reports of M'Dama having an interest in art.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreece:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBond and Rala arrive in Athens, driving in an Aston Martin. Rala takes a swig of whiskey, stating, \" Alright, Bond, what happened in Egypt stays in Egypt. \" Bond pulls into the casino lot and says,\" We'll talk about that later. Right now, we have to find Jul M'Dama. \" Rala agrees and walks inside the building. Rala then places an earpiece in Bond's ear, walking away. Bond says,\" You look good, Rala, I'd never expected a Sangheili to wear a dab of makeup. It makes you look quite nice.\" Rala replies,\" You don't look half bad in that suit, either. Also, I was raised around 4 sisters, and in my culture, men wear more makeup than the girls.\" Bond says,\" Did you see the excess of Covenant mercenaries in here?\" Rala replies,\" Yeah, these guys probably are on to us.\" Bond says,\" I've spotted him, give me second.\" Rala says,\" Want me to assist?\" Bond says,\" Yes. I'm sure having an attractive partner will add to the cover.\" The pair approach the table, with Rala leaning on a pillar. Bond sits down, glaring at a trio of Sangheili. Rala notices the Sangheili and says,\" The prick in the middle is obviously M'Dama. The brown one is Sivo Kutanee, the insane one. The silver one is Faro Rofam, a brutish monster. The only problem is that Kutanee and Rofam are part of a trio. The third one's probably hiding around here.\" Bond replies,\" If he shows up, tell me.\" Bond then says to Jul, \" Well, hello. I do hope you can spare a set of cards.\" Jul replies,\" Of course... Rofam, take a drink break and hand over your cards to him.\" Rofam grunts and says,\" Alright... But make sure I get my share.\" Jul lights a cigarette and says,\" I hope you can play cards well, Mister?\" Bond replies smoothly, \" Bond, James Bond.\" A bit later, and Bond sits with 3000 dollars, stating, \" It looks like I cleaned you out.\" Bond hears heavy breathing behind him, then getting spooked by a large arm slamming down on the table. Bond turns to face a slightly larger sangheili in purple armor, who says,\" Such a strange coincidence that you won, eh, Mr. Bond?\" Bond quips,\" And you are?\" The elite replies,\" N'Thare Vasov... \" Jul scoffs and says,\" Vasov! Give the man some air!\" Vasov glares at Jul before stepping back, menacingly stating,\" I'll deal with you later, Jul...\" Jul flips N'Thare off before saying,\" I apologize Mister Bond, for his rudeness and the fact I have to leave.\" Bond replies,\" No worries, I have to go also.\" Bond meets up with Rala and says,\" We need to leave, they're working for someone I know to well.\" Jul says to his men,\" Task a crew. Blofeld will surely want his head for his mantle.\" Bond overhears this and rushes out, as SPECTRE agents watch him. Bond reaches his car when a SPECTRE agent aims a rifle at him. Rala takes him out with a neck snap, stating,\" You wanna stand around and wait to get shot?!\" Bond says,\" Well, we need to follow Jul, so I placed a bug on his escort. We're off to New Orleans.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Orleans:\n\n\nBond and Rala catch a taxi and take a ride. The spy asks,\" Do you want to make some extra money?\" to the driver. The driver responds, \" Sure, what do ya wanna know?\" Bond replies,\" You've ever heard of Baron Samedi?\" The driver pauses for a moment, before responding, \" Yeah, I've heard of him. The guy's a local celebrity. \" Bond pats the driver before handing him 20 dollars. The pair get out, with the driver radioing in, \" Yo, Kutanee, that honkey you mentioned showed up. You want him dead?\" Kutanee replies,\" Take the fucker out, do it cleanly... \" Several cars full of hitmen and gangsters patrol the area, watching Bond and Rala. Rofam also the pair, ordering several SPECTRE agents to follow. Bond notices a trio of killers in an alleyway, whispering, \" Get your gun ready... \" Bond draws his Walther PPK and fires at the killers, killing two of them, before grabbing Rala and rushing off. A mercenary climbs into view and swings at Rala, who stabs the female merc with her own knife. A gunman appears and fires at Bond. Rala grabs a dropped gun and shoots the gunman dead, before grabbing Bond and shooting another mercenary. Bond shoots a werewolf goon dead, having the body fall off a balcony. Faro screams into the radio, \" What is wrong with you people?! Can't you kill a man!?\" The pair continue walking down the sidewalk, glancing at empty apartments and old cars. The henchmen back off, shocked that their best couldn't stop Bond. Bond and Rala meet up with Xeno and Sywn, who are held up inside a wrecked steamboat. They walk onboard, Bond saying,\" Xeno, what are you doing in the swamp?\" Nora and Freddy the Jackal pilot the ship, Xeno lounging in an old saloon. He says,\" The good people in the CIA bought us this so we can monitor the Covenant. There's been Phantom's and Banshee's flying in and out for weeks. Shit's messed up right now, people are afraid... I can't blame 'em though, what with the zombies and all.\" Rala nervously chuckles and says,\" Zombies aren't real, right? There aren't zombies in the swamp, right?\" Xeno drinks a shot of whiskey, replying, \" Oh, my feminine fellow, you mean to say you don't know the stories? The exploits of our dear friends Zoe and Ashlyn?\" Rala shrugs and drinks a beer. Xeno smirks and says,\" A few years ago, the lovely ladies went to this island, Moonscar Island. On the island, well, the locals said that 4 kids and a dog encountered a horde of Colonial era zombies, which were victims of werecats. The lesbian couple we know and love dealt with werecats as well, but forgot to put the zombies to rest. Now they haunt the swamp area, somehow managing to get off the island.\" Bond places his hand on his forehead, stating coldly,\" I just want to know what we're dealing with.\" Xeno snickers and says cheerfully, \" Sangheili, Kig-Yar, Unggoy, Mercenaries, Zombies. I'd suggest taking them out slowly and with stealth. If you want to stop SPECTRE, you need to lure them out.\" Bond replies with a quip,\" This isn't a difficult task.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwampish Land:\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoke blows around a SPECTRE agent, who puts a cigarette out with his boot. The wind howls in the area, winding through the trees and branches. The area is an amalgamation of old ships, which clearly shows, scrap metal being welded as armor, an old strip of an aircraft carrier serving the same purpose, that of a landing pad. The control area looks like a child put random parts together with glue, colors not matching and shattered windows. Jul rests his leg on a couch, assembled from gator skin, as he snorts a line of cocaine, explaining to N'Thare, \" When you've seen what I've seen, N'Thare, you'd appropriate a dab of crack. It's like a pain being relieved, no, reversed. The feeling of this stuff reminds me the Brutes... The way they ascend to another plane of existence when enraged, that exact feeling, is something that I crave more than money, more than power. It's as if my core being is fueled by this shit...\" N'Thare scoffs, saying,\" Let me deal with Bond. I have a way to turn his death into a weapon.\" Jul replied, \" Alright, but keep Rala alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAboard the steamboat, several SPECTRE mercenaries hold the heroes at gunpoint. Bond is taken to another boat, this one a Civil War Dreadnought. Bond wakes up, realizing his hands are tied to a chair. He looks around, glaring at several Elites and Mercenaries. N'Thare arrives, eerily walking towards Bond, gripping a prod. Vasov says,\" Wow... James Bond, Britain's top man, the main target of SPECTRE... Pfft!! You're nothing! \" Bond replies,\" It's not very original to tie your enemy to a wooden chair.\" N'Thare glares at Bond, marching towards the spy and saying,\" I could kill all of SPECTRE, and not feel a thing. Those narrow sighted people, those oblivious fools... I still remember my first kill, to this day... It was in Syria, I was stationed as a rifleman. One night, 7 enemies crept into the camp, taking knives and slitting my squad open, all as they slept. When they reached my tent, my partner woke up, only to be strangled by this girl. She couldn't have been more than 14 or 15, but the way she strangled my mate, as I sat tied up, she wasn't a sane person. When she turned to face me, I slashed her in the face... The pair of boys watching me quickly became impaled with tools. In the moment, the surviving squad members had tied up that girl. She cried that the men were going to hurt her. In the moment, I felt like she and I were connected. They placed her on the ground, ready to sacrifice her. I knew that whatever that army would've given me wasn't worth watching that girl be turned into a sex slave. I gave up a future and shot the man about to hurt her. The others weren't any easier to kill. After the last man fell, I untied the girl and told her to run. What happened after this changed my outlook. She said the men were looking for her, intent on selling her for money, and they were members of SPECTRE. After that, I joined SPECTRE, intent on giving this girl a life. When I found the man who sent us out there, I killed him. Blofeld knew that he was a monster, so he didn't kill me. That girl became a daughter of mine, but I knew that people like her shouldn't be allowed out in this world with monsters. I found comfort in the fact that she's the same race as me. So now I kill people to allow the best for my Vixen. You, James Bond, are a threat to my, no, SPECTRE's new world, you, the CIA, Mi6, all need to die...\" Bond replies,\" Shame, I thought you would've been aware that Xeno and Sywn already escaped and are heading here right now.\" N'Thare stumbles back and grabs a Sangheili in a skirt, who was holding a shotgun. Nora appeared and kicked N'Thare in the face, grabbing the girl. Xeno frees Bond and hands him a gun. Bond shoots a Sangheili, while Nora throws another into the furnace. The heroes escape the craft, Sywn dislodging the Dreadnought from the Steamboat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXeno cheers like a madman, before turning to stare at the girl, who is glaring down at the water. Sywn asks,\" What are we gonna do with her? She's fuckin' mute, works for Vasov, and doesn't look to be anywhere near sane!\" Vixen, the Sangheili girl, screeches at a bird, rushing towards it like a rabid animal. Bond grabs Rala and pulls him out of the way, before aiming at Vixen and saying, \" I don't want to hurt you, but you have to behave. \" Vixen, clearly confused, crouches down and appears to fall asleep. Bond, confused, slowly approaches the young Sangheili, who is now clearly asleep, like a bat if it were pointed upwards. Bond nudges Vixen, who doesn't respond, instead cooing like a baby animal. Xeno says,\" Great, the brat's asleep... We should throw her overboard. \" Bond picks Vixen up, and carries her to the cargo hold, binding her hands and placing her on the ground softly. In the morning, Bond wakes up, groaning and rolling over to see Vixen, fast asleep next to Bond's bed, hands untied. Rala says,\" Ok, that's kinda cute, seeing her like that.\" Vixen wakes up, glaring out the window at the trees. Bond sneaks out, finding Xeno in the kitchen. \"We should feed that girl, she's not even attacking us.\" The spy said. Xeno, annoyed, replied,\" I don't care... She's a SPECTRE agent. She's gonna kill us.\" The doors creaks open, wit a scurrying sound running past the pair. Bond says,\" She would've found this place anyway, Xeno. I'll bet she's hungry. Aren't you, Vixen?\" The girl popped up and clawed a piece of meat from the counter, running off and slamming the door to a cabinet after crawling inside. Xeno scoffs,\" Get the hell outta my sister's shit!\" From inside the cabinet, could be heard the sounds of something being consumed, as if by a predator. The next sound was more concerning, as it was the sound of a gun being cocked. Bond realized his Walther was missing, then that Vixen must have it. Xeno turned quiet, saying,\" She's not gonna use it on us, James. She's gonna use it on herself...\" Bond then hears soft crying in the cabinet, the prelude to suicide, which he knew all to well. Xeno walked up and said closely, \" Don't let her become like Vesper, she doesn't have to die...\" Bond rushed over, pulling the door open and grabbing Vixen from the cabinet.  The girl softly wept, reaching for anything. Bond realized why she only now tried offing herself, it was him, he gave her hope, hope for a better life, something that Vasov couldn't give. Bond said with a hint of pain in his voice, \" I know what's it's like to loose someone... You feel like everything around you is evil and out to get you... I know because I lost someone close to me, a girl...\" Vixen stopped trying to grab at things, instead rubbing Bond's arm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnding:\n\n\n\nBond would be called back to London, taking Rala and Vixen along with. The spy would be sent on a new mission, accompanied by the pair. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Be Continued...",
        "One time during the year of 2015, I was just chilling at my bed, all of a sudden I heard a shot, this kept me alert since it also felt very close judging by how loud it was, this kept me alert and I turned off the lights, about 15 minutes later I hear two shots, later about 5 seconds it was silent, then one more shot this time it was even more terrifying since I heard a man scream loudly, then there was silence for the entire night, I didn't hear about any cops because I fell at sleep, it was around 11PM that night.",
        "I went camping with my bf [here](https://imgur.com/a/RzaatRJ) we set up our tent in the middle of a river bank and stayed over night. He is a fisherman and left fish near our tent before bed. We woke up to a raccoon eating the fish. I tried to move them and got blood on my hands, plus a little blood on my face. It\u2019s about a mile hike to get to our car. I started bringing back blankets and bloody towels (blood from the fish) by myself. It was a Monday at 6AM, already super bright because this was in the middle of summer. \n\nOnce I reached the top, a car speeding at 65MPH started blaring their horn at me. The car whipped a U turn and drove up to me on a gravel road. It was an old SUV, the guy in the car had dark skin, he was wearing a dress shirt with a vest and fedora. I thought he was old trying to look young. He was smoking a cigar and had a blue can, some type of off brand cola. I had my sweatshirt hood up and greasy hair from being outside for over a day. \n\nHim: \u201cdid you just kill someone?\u201d\nI explained what happened. He starts flirting with me, asking for my # and asking if I do drugs etc. I got offended and locked myself in my car because I didn\u2019t want to talk to him. The last thing he said to me was \u201cdang, maybe you really did kill someone.\u201d He crushed the blue off brand cola, threw it on the gravel road and sped off. \n\nA week later we found out a little boy went missing near our camp. Same day. They found out he drowned in the river. I wonder if fedora guy thought I had something to do with it.",
        "The dungeon from space\nChapter 1. The ship\n   \n  Once this planet used to be a beautiful lush paradise. It was full of animals of all sizes, and plants that seemed to stretch to the sky. Sadly we humans have only destroyed our planet with chemicals, cheap plastics, and whatever else we could find. All in the name of progress. As our progress pushed on to space our planet started to die. We tried in vein to save it, we attempted to undo hundreds of years of damage, to no avail. Our only hope to survive was to head for the stars. Long before we decided to move planets we sent out satellites, and signals, and we scanned the galaxy looking for new planets maybe even life. One of the last projects to be sent out to space to find us hope was project Phoenix 7. It was supposed to head to space faster that anything else before it. The satellite launched with complete success heading for new unseen places searching for hope. But I\u2019m never made it. The project was destroyed by an unknown entity. What we would later discover to be a ship of unknown origins that was almost the same size as the moon. This ship later called \u201cThe Castle\u201d was heading straight for Earth. So now instead of us reaching space for survival we were going to have to keep space from destroying us, or so we thought. As the massive ship got closer the greatest minds we had tried everything they could to contact the ship, but no answer came. Until the day it reached Jupiter we got our first bit of contact. What we received was a warning telling us to prepare for It\u2019s arrival. So that\u2019s what we did we prepared. Military powers who had been at war for almost a century put down their arms to work together. Others believed themselves to powerful to help the other nations, and stayed on their own soil recalling all troops and citizens home to defend their homeland. Others started to invade their neighbors trying to gain a footing, and take control. Most people didn\u2019t seem to worried about the threat thinking it would be handled. Some began to pray to their God, other gods, hell some even prayed to the ship it\u2019s self believing it to be their salvation. Once the ship was about the same distance from us as Mars we world governments launched their attack they fired every single nuclear warhead they could find, steal, borrow, or buy. It took the nukes 2 weeks to reach their target. But once they did the ship was hit with enough force that scientists estimate it could have destroyed the moon 3 times over. But the ship never stopped it didn\u2019t even slow down. Shortly after the failed attempt at destroying it the ship sent another message this one was longer than the last, it told us how we had ruined our planet, abused it for eons never truly appreciating what it had given us. It said we were savages for this, but we were redeemable as a species. It told us it could help save our planet, and give us advance space travel technology light years ahead of our own. Apparently the ship had been watching us for several decades all the way back to when the first nukes were tested. It watched us. Scanned our planet only to find it slowly decaying slowly as we poisoned it. The ship then told us it was programmed to help planets, and species like us to either save that planet by eradicating the species, or elevating the species to a higher technological understanding. But this elevation would cost us. We had to redeem ourselves prove to the ship that we could be better. The ship wanted us to come together as humans to help save the world we lived on. We could do this together, or we could all die as a species. Now in order to claim our new technology, and save the planet and ourselves we simply had to send people to clear the 100 or so levels of the ship. It was a deceivingly simple task. As the ship finally stopped moving towards us it sent out hundreds of little ships to Earth to act as teleports to the ship. Anyone could go, and try to clear the floors it did not care who it was. The ship had a few rules 1. To enter the floors you need to be in a party no fewer than 3, 2. No one can participate if they are their for strictly personal gains, 3. The advancements given by the ship cannot be used to harm another living thing, and cannot be used for financial gains, 4. Anyone why harbors hatred for any group of peoples will be put on trial, and publicly shamed, and executed. It did clarify that hating a group of peoples meant, hating someone based off of race, nationality, or beliefs. We would later find out that you cannot hide these feeling from the ship, best guess was that it could read your mind but most likely it had access to our info stored on the internet. Like the private conversations we would have with loved ones, or our friends with some kind of technology around that would pick it up. But true to it\u2019s word it did publicly execute several people. The first was a US Army operative that was sent with the first team. He was almost immediately grabbed in the starting grounds were everyone starts. He was pulled from his team, and they had to watch as their friend, and teammate of several years was outed as a Nazi sympathizer, and how he had not only bet an old Jewish man to death but how he had run the mans family from their homes with a shotgun. The whole time screaming at the screen asking how it knew about that, and that he shouldn\u2019t be there",
        "Back in highschool, I went to a charter school but I knew some kids who went to the regular public high school and one of these guys during the summer bought of bunch of weed edible cookies off his local dealer, and then when HS started for him, he brought these cookies to school ate one and started handing them out to people (he did at least tell them there was weed first) and the next day, he came in late because he had a doctors appointment and the time he came in, he saw his PE class walking outside so he went to join them and the school cop approached him and said \u201ccome with me\u201d and she took him to this little office where she then said \u201cI heard you were a pretty good baker with those cookies\u201d and at that point he knew he was fucked, so he told addmitted it, and after some talking with him and his parents they decided to expel him for the year and send him to an alternative school for the remainder of his freshman year (different school not the one I was in) which he absolutely hated until he got to come back to the public school and he made sure not to bring weed again.",
        "Ahh here it came. It\u2019s a feeling that starts in your feet and goes up your asshole to your shoulders and jaw. Sweat and blood mixing around to strange parts of your body as the adrenaline shoots through you like pins. Your mind deteriorates, falling apart like an ice cream cone in boiling water. The only thing your brain leaves is your eyes and a terror to destroy your abilities. One of them being rational thinking of emotions. No one is happy, all are slaves to money. We are all in a deep pocket of hell with customizable check books and skim milk. You are as feel bad as bad as them. You are all alone.\nThe adrenaline starts scratching around your brain until it hits your ability to remember\u2026\nYour back and damaged. You remember the feeling like you were in the backseat of a car slowly plunging into a lake. Water rising, air fizzing out like an Alka-Seltzer tablet for your spinning head. I didn\u2019t remember how I got here but I know where I was and I know where home is. I drove out passing the big H sign. I passed a couple greens before entering my neighbourhood.",

What should I draw first? Hmmm... Oh how about some people first! And then the scenery and animals\n\nThis is one of his favourite hobbies to past the time in peace \n\nLuca: *Humming while drawing* (this is my favourite time to have peace. No one to disturb me and forgetting all the idiots in my school for once...) \n\n(1 hour of drawing later...) \n\nLuca: wow i got some drawings done! This is a great feeling after all! To forget the dumb stuff my class does...  Maybe I'll have some more time to draw but maybe this time in the forest but I better not be that far away. Because I have all of my groceries in my backpack plus all if the pastries and clothes in my extra backpack (this is why I always have two backpacks just in case...) oh well time to go to the forest to feel and draw the scenery well. \n\nLuca is off to head to forest but he also promise himself that he won't get very far deep into the forest. \n\nLuca: *Humming while walking* (this is nice...) \n\nLuca sits down next to a tree and starts drawing the scenery. But this isn't his first time in the forest but this is his 40th time in this particular forest just to draw in different locations. \n\nLuca: I should use more color in my drawings in natural color next time so that I can feel the essence of the scenery. \n\n(after three more hours of drawing later.) \n\nLuca: ah I got some nice drawings in there. But what's the time now... Oh shit it's 6 pm I better run now to prepare dinner!\n\n(suddenly luca heard some noises in the forest.)\n\nLuca: wait who's there?!

        "There\u2019s a community center near where I grew up that I have no good memories of, every memory I have of that place is horrible, nothing good ever came out of that place. Here is one such memory I have of that place.\n\nThis community center has an ice skate rink that\u2019s pretty popular, and I\u2019d often find myself there for one reason or another. I couldn\u2019t ice skate, but I was there because of a summer activity or something, and because I couldn\u2019t ice skate I often found myself chilling in the waiting area while I waited for my group to finish ice skating. There were arcade games there, but I often didn\u2019t have any quarters to play the games, but I often found myself watching the preview videos they\u2019d play and being entertained. Life was boring before smartphones were a thing.\n\nAnyways, while I can\u2019t remember when this story took place, I want to say that I was at a birthday party that was at the ice rink, and on this particular day I was in the waiting area with a friend I\u2019ll call Bob. So while I was waiting for time to pass, I decided to \u201cplay\u201d the arcade games (didn\u2019t have any quarters with me) but suddenly, some weird redhead kid begins to shove me out of the way shouting \u201cmy turn!\u201d. Even though I wasn\u2019t playing the game, I still didn\u2019t take too kindly to being shoved out of nowhere, and luckily for me I was much bigger than this kid so his shoving did little more than annoy me a little. Naturally I shoved back, resulting in this kid resorting to trying to bite me, but luckily at this point Bob intervened and pulled him off of me (Bob later claimed that the kid tried to punch him which he blocked and knocked him onto another arcade game, but considering he was right next to me when he pull the kid away and I didn\u2019t see any of that happen, I highly doubt he was telling the truth).\n\nFast forward a couple of minutes I\u2019m sitting on some benches with my back to the arcade games, and another kid in our group I\u2019ll call Lenny was standing at the arcade games. Same redhead kid comes back and approached Lenny, and Lenny greeted him by asking \u201cdid you want to play on the games?\u201d to which the redhead kid responded by kicking Lenny, while wearing ice skates I might add, in his inner thigh, causing Lenny to collapse against the wall. At this point I took noticed and all I could do was watch in horror as the redhead continued his assault onto Lenny with a fury of punches. Luckily the rest of the kids in our group pulled him off and the redheads presumed father\u2019s came and took him away from our group. Last I saw of the kid was him crying while his father yelled at him.\n\nLuckily for Lenny, the kick to his thigh didn\u2019t seriously injure him, only caused him to be in a lot of pain. And luckily that kid never bothered us again. Still, it is one of the many reasons I hate the community center.",
        "Thank you. For this",
        "So first off I had a great time. He was so nice to me and he even smiled at me it made me really happy  . Guys the first thing that came out my mouth when I met him was Hi I'm scared lol. I can't believe myself.   So yeah that's how everything went on Wednesday",
        "I was in bed and I smelt something sweet in the air. I got up and headed over to the kitchen. It\u2019s early morning and I saw my father already has the cotton candy machine out. \u201cWhat\u2019re you making this time?\u201d \nHe turns around and says \u201cGood morning\u201d. \n\u201cMorning\u201d. \n\u201cTry this\u201d he hands me a big pink fluffy batch of cotton candy on a stick. I tried it and it tasted pretty good. It was sweet but it had an odd flavor to it. \n\u201cI can\u2019t figure out the flavor, what\u2019d you use this time?\u201d \nMy mother walks into the kitchen and says \u201cHe\u2019s using birds.\u201d \n\u201c...... Birds? I\u2019m a little confused.\u201d\n    My father motioned for me to come over to him. I walk over and see a dead bird on the counter. Not washed or anything. Everything completely attached to it like it was freshly killed. He took the bird and placed it into the cotton candy machine. He added a little bit of white sugar and red food coloring to it. He then heated up the machine and rolled out a perfect stick of pink cotton candy. \n\u201cEw what the hell?!\u201d I exclaimed.\n\u201cBut it was good wasn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\u201cYeah it was till I found out what it was!\u201d I started to gag. \nMy father grabbed me by the hand and took me to the living room. I saw his bird feeder outside. It was huge with multiple bird feeders attached to it. He always loves to feed the birds and just watch them fly around. He even talks to me about the different types of birds he sees and takes pictures of each one of them. \n\u201cHere\u201d he said. He opens the window and snatches a bird from outside. The bird flaps its wings trying to escape from his grasp.\n     \u201cWhat are you--\u201d \nSuddenly he starts smashing the bird against the window cill. \n\u201cSTOP WHAT ARE YOU DOING\u201d I yell. \nHe proceeds to hit it over and over and over again. Blood was splattering everywhere, even his face was covered in blood. I hear my mother behind me start to laugh, my father does as well. The hitting becomes more intense and pieces of the bird start flying everywhere. Both their laughter starts to turn hysterical. \n    \u201cSTOP IT PLEASE STOP\u201d. \nTheir laughter just gets more and more intense. It\u2019s even piercing to the ear. I cover my ears but the noise seems to just get louder. I squeezed my eyes shut and dropped to the floor praying for their laughter and hitting to stop.\n\u201cWhy are you guys doing this?!?!\u201d \nThat\u2019s when I finally woke up in my bed. My ears were ringing from the noise. My body felt numb. Luckily it was all over.",
        "So there's construction going on downstairs where I live and things are going through a remodeling and the walls are bare, no doors no hiding places, I go past a hallway and enter from my right into the restroom. This is a small restroom, one with a corner shower, so like a square, you have the sink at the topleft, shower on the topright, toilet on the bottomright and the entrance on the bottomleft.\n\nI turn on the lights located on the bottom wall and without much  thought, in one fluid motion, turn and pull my underwear down and sit  on the  shitter. After pissing and pooping, I turn around for the toilet paper located above the toilet tank, I notice in the corner of my eye a tiny insect with my poor ass vision, located at the far end of the corner shower, the glass isn't in place yet. I can't even squint to see how  many legs the thing has.\\* It is the size of a ????\\*\\* the diameter with it's legs out one centimeter. It crawls along the wall, over the  lip of the shower towards me as I'm sitting on the shitter. At this point it had made it to just almost past the edge of the toilet tank when I got up to wipe my butt, and then the insect stopped..\n\n\"I was like fuccckkkk what the fuck would I have done if it got any closer and I wasn't done wiping? Would I have been mad jumping like crazy if it got to me with my pants down? I don't even fucking know... \"\n\nI finish wiping my butt put the paper in the toilet and flush. I take one step towards the washing hands area and the cockroach crawls closer to me, I look it in the eye to get a better look and it starts  flopping  around like it's about to fly. Taken by surprise, I take a  step back  towards the wall left wall. I contemplate for a moment about  what I just saw. wtf, you're telling me this little shit has been  crawling this  whole time and it's got a broken wing or some shit? We  both walk towards  each other and it's crawling again and stops. By this point it has made it to right underneath the toilet.\n\nI walk up to it and try to step on it, It jumps away, I was like holy fuck that's not any spider I know to be able to jump back like that! It jumps a few times and lands on top of the shower lip. We stare at each   other for probably I don't know how long. I go into step on it again and again it jumps away into the shower floor. I give a stomp on the lip of the shower and it hops back towards the wall and onto the part where the shower lip meets the wall. Now it is just chilling there. I walk back towards the sink Now we're at opposite ends of the room.\n\nI start talking to it \"You little shit! Are you fucking spying on me? Are you a fucking government little remote device spying on me?\n\nI begin washing my hands and afterwards, bring out my cup, toothpaste, and brush from the cabinet built into the sink. I put them on the sink counter and close the cabinet. I fill up the cup with water and begin washing my teeth.\\*\\*\\* This whole time, I'm looking at the insect with the corner of my eye as I brush. I think about how fucking advanced our spying tech must be to be able to spy on people with tiny insects and was like nah... I then noticed it was raining outside and thought about why an insect would be in this place with literally no food and the smell of construction. Maybe it's here to just avoid the rain... There are all these houses near me? probably with food inside.. Why would you be in the one with jack dirt for food? You a good insect that is just avoiding the heavy rain? You feed on the stuff outside durrrrrr... I'm just your temporary shelter... I'll let you live...\n\nI finish washing my teeth and put the stuff back in the cabinet, close the lights and leave the restroom with my back to the insect not to know what it will do and where it will go from here.\n\nSoo many questions unanswered...\n\n\\#1) Is it spy tech?\n\n\\#2) What the fuck was it? ... my eyesights bad..\n\n\\#3) How long will it stay? If I were to check all the little nooks and crannys when construction is done... will we find anything? Lurking around waiting for people to move in and provide foodddd???\n\n\\#4) Will it remember that I tried to kill it and haunt me or whoever comes after and haunt them with multitudes of their brood? does it even know I had soo many more chances to kill it and didn't, not that I spared  its  life or anything... Fuck how does the insect remember this experience?\n\nThoughts that came up while writing this:\n\n\\*o wowww, soo many people be wearing glasses nowadays, very young too, I wonder why, but I wonder if people back then could use squinting powers to lessen the amount of light and detail passing thru the eye so they can see details from far away like a built in telescope....\n\n\\*\\*my mind blanked when thinking about universally small objects to compare things with.. a dime or penny isn't universal peoples.. fingers are different sizes.. best I could come up with is smaller than a small bottlecap for water.\n\n\\*\\*\\*How do ya'll wash your teeth? Like we never go with a group of people and all of us brush teeth at the same time... to compare toothbrushing techniques? compare our different toothbrushes and toothpaste...\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*If I was an absolute insane madman, at any time in the story... I brought my face as close as possible to the insect and stared them right in the soul...and exert my dominance... or is it my will to help? or maybe they would have jumped on my face... fuck I don't know",
        "We need to find Damien. All the doors are locked on the upper floors and the elevators aren\u2019t working. He\u2019s in that room. He\u2019s in danger. We need to find Damien. \u201cGuys, get the crowbar.\u201d Two guys go get the crowbar and everyone else tries breaking through the doors. They get back and start to ply open one of the elevators. The guys finally get it open. I see two girls run down the hall to the left to go get Damien.\n\nI walk into the room straight ahead. I see multiple people lying down on the ground. I walk into another room straight ahead. There\u2019s even more people. A few young adults, some children, and even some toddlers. They all look faint and grey. The girls who went to look for Damien bolt back into the room.\u201dWe can\u2019t find him!!\u201d They yell. One of the people on the ground faintly said \u201cDamien? I dream of him every night\u201d and to us that signified that he had passed away. We all look around the room. It became very quiet. \n\nWe then decide to ask what happened to them. They said they were a part of an experiment. They were all tested on and put into a big machine. The little ones compared it to a vending machine. We then start to haul one by one down stairs. Starting with the younger kids. When we picked them up they fell limp. Like they had absolutely no strength. We were running down stairs and passing the bodies to one another. I finally woke up when someone tried to hand me a baby from upstairs and I dropped him down the stairs ):",
        "  Hunting is a common tradition for a boy to transition into a man, and Clint wasn't about to let his boy pass that up on his thirteenth birthday as much as his wife didn't believe in it. Clint was a man's man standing a 6'5 and 250 lbs and looked like a fit Santa Claus minus all the red, but his son was a split imagine of his mother. Short, soft and the kindest thing that everyone in town loved, and looked up to his father like no other. It didn't take much convincing and before he knew it, Clint and Kyle were on their way to bag their first elk of the year.\n\n  Clint prepped his son as much as possible the days leading up to the trip, and gave Kyle all the tips and tricks he could on his way there. The real lesson didn't start until they got to their destination and their boots touched the ground that glorious morning. They packed only necessities, took their rifles and a sidearm for an overnight stay with the intention of hiking to Clints, \"secret spot,\" one day and teaching Kyle the basics of tracking along the way, then hunting the next.\n\n  From sifting through animal droppings to pointing out raked trees, Clint was a god of the forest to Kyle as he soaked in all the information in amazement on their way to their campsite. The two closed in on their destination when Kyle noticed markings on a tree, \"Hey Pa, we don't have to worry about bears or anything right?\" Clint let out a chuckle before responding, \"Boy, you don't have to worry about shit just as long as you pay attention and mind your own, and if that don't work,\" Clint patted the sidearm on his hip, \"we got this bad boy right here.\"\n\n  Clint could see that wasn't comforting so he asked the million dollar question, \"Why do you ask?\" Kyle shrugged his shoulders then pointed at a tree that Clint had simply overlooked. \"Well, that don't look right. Haven't heard of there being any bears around here.\" said Clint as he inspected the gashes in the bark. He ran his fingers in the grooves left by something far bigger than a grizzly then sniffed them.\n\n  \"Oh fuck! Straight smells like shit.\" said Clint trying to make a joke without showing concern. He looked at his hand and pulled a splinter from his finger before looking back at Kyle and smiled, \"Let's backtrack a bit to my old spot. We should get there before sundown and you get to see my ol' stompin' grounds.\" Kyle nodded, grinning from ear to ear and they went on their way.\n\n  They got there just in time before sundown just like Clint predicted and set up camp. Clint watched his boy struggle with his tent, but Kyle was a very independent kid so he just let him be. Clint set up a fire while Kyle finished with his own tent project with a child's pride, and soon after that they both went into their tents to get ready for the big day.\n\n  The unzipping of his fathers tent woke Kyle up from a light sleep. Kyle assumed he needed to, \"drain the lizard,\" as his father liked to say. He heard his fathers footsteps followed by a loud groan. Kyle laid there for a few minutes before realizing his father was taking quite a while so he thought to go check on him, and so he did with his flashlight and rifle in hand. Kyle scanned their campsite with no sight of his father until his light landed on a set of footprints where their fire sat.\n\n  Kyle's first thought was his father might have stepped on some smoldering embers that lead to the groan until he heard his father in the distance letting out another. \"Dad?\" Kyle whispered aloud hoping it was enough to reach his father, but not to draw any unwanted attention. After waiting a few seconds without a response, Kyle took a deep breath thinking the worst and knowing that he was going to put his fathers lessons to the test.\n\n  The footsteps died off in the brush leaving a small trail of blood from his father walking barefoot for Kyle to track. He followed the trailblazed path through the forest noticing more trees had the same markings him and his father had seen the day prior. Before he knew it, his father's groans became louder and louder mixed with sobs until he had finally come across a narrow cave where the trail continued.\n\n  All Kyle could think about were bears, but hearing his fathers groans and cries pushed it from his mind. Keeping the light low and his rifle at the ready, Kyle crept into the cave hugging the wall. \"D-d-dad?\" Kyle whispered again as his fathers groans grew louder the deeper he went into the cave. The cave expanded when he entered a cavern with a loud snap startling him. Out of instinct, Kyle turned off his light, dropped to a knee and tried to calm his breath with the sound of his father moaning and crying, paired with the sound of something tearing into flesh.\n\n  Kyle shakily raised his flashlight in the direction of where the noise was coming from and quickly turned it on and off. He put his hand to his mouth to hold in a scream and to keep the bile from coming up while he listened to his father moaning in pain and pleasure. Kyle shakily raised his rifle, resting it on his forearm and trained the light in the direction of the nightmare. He flicked the switch to see that what he had seen was unfortunately true.\n\n  His father was laying on the ground facing away from him naked and grinding on a beast that had buried its long face into the space in between his neck and shoulder. Its blood matted mane covered its eyes with pointed ears barely poking out like they were hiding in tall grass. It hugged his father Clint with long, frail arms that had cat-like paws at the end of them and its legs that were all the same. Its body was horse shaped and looked too heavy for the beast to move gracefully, if at all, on its dilapidated limbs.\n\n  It didn't even look up; it was so focused on its meal. Kyle wiped tears from his face trying to get a steady shot as his father moaned louder, grabbing the beast and pulling himself closer against it while it dug into his shoulder. With the beast in his sights, Kyle squeezed the trigger to see his fathers head jerk forward, then watch his body go limp. The beast took its maw out of its meal to look at Kyle with white eyes and let out a hiss.\n\n  Kyle turned around and ran as fast as he could out of the cave and didn't stop until his body felt it was no longer in danger. A hunter saw him wandering around the woods all by himself a few days later. They searched for Clint for a few fruitless days, and took Kyle home to his mother. Kyle hadn't spoken since that day or touched another gun at that, but he'd never look at a cat the same again.",
        "# [Humans are Weird: We Took A Vote BOOK 2 | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)\n\n# [Humans are Weird \u2013 Call and Response - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/qIdS-nsk9Y0)\n\nFor one blessed day, the shared data processing space on the integrated base had been calm, quiet, and in general an efficient work zone. The room was a massive dome to accommodate the bipedal members of the survey teams. Four gently murmuring streams divided the workspace into quarters that circled the central ponds. The ceiling was a network of exposed struts that contained and concealed the Winged\u2019s offices. Certain patches, equidistant from the water, glowed comfortingly in the infrared spectrum.\n\nIt was on one of these that Observer Grisssk lounged. The warming stone might have been clawed specifically for him for how comfortable it was. His claws tapped lightly over the screen as he entered the rough data for the final observation he had taken. He still had to write a report for each of the bare-bones datasets, but at last, the nigh impossible task seemed manageable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy being an observer,\u201d he growled to himself. He took pains to pitch his voice to low for any of his colleagues to hear. He was no grumbling hatchling who needed a nice rub over his eye ridges to calm down. Given that the humans were exceptionally good at that sort of thing, these were working hours, and he had a professional reputation to maintain. Still, one did need to vent their gasses before they turned to flame. His tongue flicked over the points of his teeth as he closed the file and leisurely stretched his tail.\n\nBeing an observer on a base that contained seven separate species living and working together was very trying. Every time he saw what he suspected to be a previously undescribed behavior, he had to note it down. Hopefully one of the cracked-skulls at the university would be able to make a proper scientific study off of his notes. He ran a critical yellow eye over the busily working researchers. To his immense relief, he noted nothing that he had not noted before.\n\nHe pulled out his datapad scored for continuing observations and rested it comfortably under one claw. There was the Winged nutritionist flitting off for his rest period. There was the Shatar linguist gently nudging her smaller mate out of their workspace. There was\u2014\n\n\u201cShe turned me into a newt!\u201d a human voice declared from some dark corner of the room.\n\nSilence broken only by the soft lapping of the water followed, and then the same warped human voice but from a different corner said, \u201cI got bettah!\u201d\n\nRaucous laughter burst from the clawcluster of humans in the room, and even the slim, male Shatar shook his antennae in mildly amused annoyance before walking off. The laughter died down, and the humans went back to their work without another word. Grisssk rubbed his clenched claws over his eye ridges and gave a tired sigh. He pulled out the new reports section and sent out a prayer that the university would send him an assistant.\n\n# [Humans are Weird \u2013 Call and Response - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/qIdS-nsk9Y0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBook 1 \"[\u200b](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)Humans are Weird: I Have the Data\"\n\n[Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RSVHL81)\n\n[Barnes & Nobe (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/humans-are-weird-adelia-gibadullina/1138927933;jsessionid=CED1CA2DD868CAE60C7F4EAC8FEDD5E5.prodny_store01-atgap01?ean=9781736003923)\n\n[Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=USta%20eBook%20by%20Betty%20Adams%20-%201230004645337%20%7C%20Rakuten%20Kobo%20United%20States)\n\n[Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# [Humans are Weird: We Took A Vote BOOK 2 | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)",
        "I co-wrote this with another cousin involved because he found some files in regards to this situation lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, I had a cousin who we called Bonnie, he was rebellious and had the 'I don't give a f\" attitude.\n\nSo as a little back info on my cousins and me, my other cousin's nickname is Guero; so Guero, Bonnie and I, are all  Mexican-Americans, born in the states BUT raised in Mexico.\n\nI actually didn't come to the states until I was 22 lol I am 28 now, anyway so Bonnie was a badass.\n\nWhen he was 17 he hung out with the neighbors of our farm, let's call them, Jykl and Hyde. \n\nJykle was running a delivery service per se, one that was making him a couple thousand a day.\n\nHis brother Hyde was his lookout at the border. Bonnie was their BFF but unlike Jykle and Hyde who were Mexican citizens, Bonnie started to help deliver stuff with Jykle, not telling him his citizenship status.\n\nAnyway, these kids did a couple of jobs may be over 10 \"runs\" Bonnie had mentioned at the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo they ended up being caught doing a double delivery, meaning they crossed over, through the desert btw, one load and had forgotten another so they went back and tried to deliver that half but were caught by CBP officers.\n\nNow I am going to tell ya'll a harsh reality of when something like this happens... when Mexican Citizens get caught in the border whether it's illegal immigrants w/ coyotes or \"mules\" CBP officers abuse them. Like this wasn't Bonnie's first rodeo, he actually had once tried to cross 10 immigrants and were caught in the TX border, where a woman he had under his care was raped brutally by CPB officers and then the officers extorted my cousin and another coyote for 50 thousand dollars to let them all go. My cousin was never the same after he told us about this incident...\n\nAnd so back to the story; Jykle and Bonnie were caught, with the merchandise by the CBP.\n\nMy cousin Bonnie liked to pretend he didn't understand English and he told us that the CBP beat the shit out of them, took their clothes off, put dirt in their mouths, kicked them to a bloody pulp, and once they were all done with that one of three took the merch and the other two threw them in the back of a unit where they had maybe 5 more people. They were from Central America he had stated, he also stated the CBP officers taking them back to a detention center bragged about killing someone and leaving them in the desert, hoping cartels would be blamed, and he stated that one of the officers even joked about doing the same with all of the men they had rounded up. My cousin understanding what was happening kept his mouth shut and let them talk, he was afraid they would change their minds if he spoke up and kill them all. \n\nBonnie used to tell us that the CBP is the most corrupt organization the united states has, and tbh after what he had told us on this day and more after, I do believe it.\n\nThankfully he was taken to a detention center on this day, once at the location again the men were searched, the other 5 men were stripped, and given a change of clothes since they were filthy. and since my cousin and his friend were half-naked\n\nAll the men had given their info and Bonnie ended up being the last one \"booked\".\n\nMy cousin Guero says that our cousin Bonnie wanted to laugh when he was fingerprinted and he was identified because according to Bonnie, he told us that the CBP officer that got him, paled, ran to the back to get another officer and he was then escorted to a dark interrogation room and left there handcuffed to a table.\n\nRemember, these CBP officers beat, stripped talked about illegal activity, AND took merchandise that an American citizen +  still a minor witnessed. These CBP officers were shitting bricks to put it lightly.\n\nThey then had my cousin taken to a hospital because of the injuries he had sustained, he didn't say a word but once he had been taken care of he told us that the CBP officers involved kept themselves REAL close to him. My cousin Bonnie was mute, one thing about who he was, was that he was an observer, I think that's why he had thrived in organized crime and he acclimated well to that lifestyle.\n\nAnyway once he was ok'd to be taken back into CBP custody he told us that one of the officers involved began to threaten him in Spanish no less, as he was driven back.\n\nThey must've assumed he didn't understand English but my cousin kept his mouth shut until he was put in a room with DEA officers, the first words out of his mouth were \"I would like to speak to my lawyer\" in perfect English.\n\nHe told us that the DEA was pissed he went that route but he got his phone call and called my cousin Guero. He wasn't a lawyer just yet at that time as he was barely pursuing that career path BUT he knew a VERY important lawyer. He actually worked for said lawyer until the man retired.\n\nBonnie told my cousin that he had gotten in some trouble and Guero went straight away to the Lawyer we knew.\n\nI actually was there when Guero had gotten the call and I tagged along, and we made our way to TX.\n\nWell once we got there, Guero and the Lawyer made their way to him and they spoke with Bonnie who gave them some vague info and also he disclosed an important detail that helped him get out w/o any repercussions.\n\nApparently, the arresting CBP officers stated that they had found my cousin and his friend crossing illegally that nothing was found on them but a water jug and a backpack. They also stated that they had assumed they had been abandoned by their coyote since they found them both beaten up. That mentioned backpack was not theirs but Bonnie didn't disclose or rebuke anything tangible to the DEA because he didn't want to go to juvie or something crazy.\n\nEverything was dropped however when my cousin told the Lawyer, he hadn't been Mirandize... the CBP officers had been soooo freaked out they had forgotten that small detail after they had fingerprinted him and taken him to the hospital.\n\nWhen I saw my cousin though, I cried like a baby. He looked like crap tbh, he had a swollen shut eye he needed help walking. Guero and the Lawyer were the ones supporting him and walking him to the car.\n\nIt was scary but my cousin healed, waited for his friend Jykle to be deported and he went back at it again.\n\nGuero and I looked back at this experience with sadness... I wish my cousin had made better choices but then again he made his decisions and he bore the consequences of them and there was nothing we could've really said or done to change what he wanted to do.",
        "As I lay on the comforts of my bed, I dangled the temptation before my eyes.

        "I was on my way to school when a van pulled out in front of me causing me to slam on the brakes. Suddenly three people come out of the van and run towards my car. I put my car in reverse and stepped on the gas. It was too late. They broke open my driver's side window and picked me up out of the car. One guy holding onto my torso and a girl on my feet. I screamed and kicked but nothing seemed to work. The third guy opened the backseat of the van and they hauled me in. They put handcuffs on me and buckled me in the middle seat so I could see them driving. They got back in the van, two in the front and one in the way back. \nI still had my phone on me. They told me if I called the cops they\u2019d shoot me. So I videotape my handcuffs and the car then post it on my snapchat story. I then turn off ghost mode so everyone can see my location. Everyone on snapchat started messaging me and most people thought it was a joke. We kept on driving towards some huge rocky mountains near a big beach. One stranger messages me and says he\u2019s at the same beach I\u2019m at. I tell him to come get me and he says no problem. The car stopped then we got out and started walking towards the beach. They\u2019re keeping close to me so no one notices I\u2019m in handcuffs. \nAll of a sudden police showed up. \u201cPUT YOUR HANDS UP\u201d they yelled. The three kidnappers then pull out guns. The police start to shoot and so do they. I run away from them and see the stranger from snapchat calling out to me. I started running towards him when suddenly a bomb dropped. He and several other people get blown into pieces. Blood and guts splattered everywhere. I ran along the shore line hoping I wouldn't get hit by the bombs. Boom boom one after another. I looked over and saw more blood and guts scattered along the beach. People were screaming and running around.\nI finally am able to escape this hell. I walk along the streets and see a TV playing \u2018Breaking News\u2019. I decided to listen. I see a picture of my kidnappers and a bunch more. Apparently they\u2019re all working together and kidnapping a bunch of people. I then hear them mention the names of everyone who was taken, my name included. The news people say that we must be careful because they\u2019re after us, and that we will be in great danger if they find us. That\u2019s when I finally woke up from the dream. I was shaking and my body still felt numb from the blasts",

        "Timmy Vagnee saw the murder of his parents while he was in their living room in the summer of 1989. He was only five years old during that time. The murderer tried to shoot Timmy, but with a saddened face, he insisted and left the house. Timmy memorized the murderer's facial features, each and every detail of his face. Without anyone in the world knowing, the five-year old already has a burning rage inside of him. Unable to say a word, Timmy approached his father and mother. Blood was oozing from the bullet hole of his parents' head. Without any knowledge on what to do, he decided to go outside, hoping someone would pick him up. Fortunately, a man walking on the street saw the poor kid. He asked for Timmy's name but Timmy did not answer. He asked another question, but again, Timmy did not answer. He thought Timmy was mute. It seems that Timmy won't speak, so he introduced himself by giving Timmy his full name. His name is Repolio Mario Bergolio Luigi. Repolio brought Timmy to the police station because he thought Timmy was lost. When they discovered that Timmy's parents were killed in a bloody murder, the police officers and Repolio were shocked and felt sad for the child. Repolio decided to adopt Timmy. It took a lot of paperwork but he was determined to take the child in his custody. After the adoption process was finished, he took Timmy to therapy to suppress the trauma of the child inflicted by the murder of his parents. Although therapy was effective, the rage inside Timmy's heart still burns like a thousand suns. Repolio aided Timmy while he was growing up and he supported Timmy in his studies and hobbies. In Repolio's perspective, Timmy was a happy, and at the same time, a clumsy boy. He loves Timmy so much, and Timmy also feels the same. For Timmy, Repolio is a father who miraculously came into his life. Repolio never sensed Timmy's thirst for vengeance on his parent's killer at all. At one point, Timmy asked Repolio to enroll him in a local dojo that teaches martial arts. Repolio did not know that it was part of Timmy's plan to seek vengeance upon the murderer. Timmy, full of anger, was planning to beat the living hell out of his parents' murderer before shooting him with a gun on his head. After years of training and studying, Timmy obtained the rank of j\u016bdan (tenth degree black belt) in the dojo, and finished his degree in law enforcement. He became a police officer and a detective afterwards.\u00a0\n\nTimmy was assigned to a police station near the house where his beloved father and mother were killed. He was looking for some files about the suspect, but unfortunately, there was none. The suspect was never found by the officers, but when Timmy saw the breaking news about the death of a woman and her daughter, he found out that the husband and father of the deceased was none other than the one who murdered his parents. He was not wrong. He knows exactly what the person he wanted to kill looks like. All the haunting memories during the summer of 1989 came flooding back. The chief police swiftly responded to the incident before the news was aired. He then called Timmy because they needed more men at the crime scene. In Timmy's mind, he thought that this moment is perfect to deliver out his vengeance upon that man named Crueger Vondikk. Like a silent assassin, Timmy headed to the scene hiding his bloodlust. He saw Crueger sitting on a chair provided by the officers near the crime scene. He approached Crueger.\u00a0\n\nIn a cold and eerie voice, Timmy said, \"Let me handle this.\"\u00a0\n\nHis fellow officers moved aside. They respect Timmy because he was the only detective in their station ever since the other one retired. Without anyone noticing, Timmy folded his fists and suddenly punched Crueger hard, so hard that it might have cracked Crueger's skull. Timmy was determined to kill Crueger even if it meant spending the rest of his life in prison. At first, Timmy's fellow officers thought that it was a punch meant to clear Crueger's mind after seeing his family die, but Timmy continued to punch and kick Crueger until he spat out blood. Suddenly, Timmy pulled out a gun, so the officers pulled out Timmy. They then saw that Timmy was crying, crying out of rage and hate. He was struggling, trying to pull himself out of the officers' grasp.\n\n\"You! I want to kill you so bad, it's irritating. I don't care that your family died! You deserve it, after you killed my parents! What? Now you are being silent as if you are the victim here? You should rot in hell, you dirty animal! People like you deserve to\u2026\"\n\nRepolio slapped Timmy before he could even finish the sentence.\u00a0\n\n\"Enough, Tim. You have said a lot.\" Repolio dramatically entered the scene.\n\nRepolio rushed to the crime scene when he heard the news. He knew that Timmy was going to be there and that he would try to kill Crueger.\n\n\"This is none of your business, Papa Rep. I have to deal with him. I have to! He killed my parents!\" Timmy, now furious more than ever. He believed this was the perfect moment for him to extract revenge.\u00a0\n\nRepolio replied without any emotion, \"I know. I know, Tim. Crueger is my cousin.\"\n\nTimmy was silent. There was no sound in his surroundings. Only his heartbeat was the only thing that was making noises.\u00a0\n\n\"You knew? But why? Why didn't you tell me? You knew!\"\n\n\"I did it because I was told to! Please listen to me. I'm sorry, I truly am! Please.\" Crueger was sobbing, trying to fit himself in the conversation.\n\nRepolio convinced Timmy to listen, and he did.\n\n\"Repolio's brother, Patate Fritte, ordered me to murder your father, your mother, and supposedly you. Your father and I were under Patate's business. We were drug dealers and he was our drug lord. Your father, Tommy, entered this illegal business because he was struggling financially, the same as me. We cannot afford to pay bills and provide the needs of our family. We were close friends even before entering the business, but this business destroyed our friendship. When your father hadn't returned the money he earned from Patate's illegal drugs, Patate ordered me to kill him and his family. I had no other choice. If I did not follow Patate's orders, I would be the one who's dead. I cannot afford that. I was dead inside, but I needed to be in that business for my family to live. I killed my friend, your father. I killed him for the sake of my wife and daughter who were struggling. I understood why Tommy did not return the money. He wanted you to have a better life even though he had to use Patate's money. But I had to kill him and his family because I need to stay in the business to provide for my family. I am sorry. Very, very sorry. And now, it's my turn to feel the pain you felt when I killed your parents. I knew this was coming since I also used Patate's money and did not return it. I thought he was going to kill me with my wife and daughter, but he spared my life only to suffer more.\" Crueger said. It was a confession he made.\n\n\"Why didn't you kill me? He was your cousin, why did he kill your family? Just who is this Patate Fritte bastard? Papa Rep, he is your brother, why didn't you file a case against him?\" Timmy asked. He was confused, not knowing how to react.\n\n\"I spared your life because I was hoping that you would kill me in the future as repayment for my sins. You were the only one who is fit to punish me in any way a punishment could be. The guilt was too much for me to handle and I wanted you to punish me sooner or later. I thought about that my whole life.\" Crueger said more.\n\n\"I filed a case against him for distributing illegal drugs, Tim. He was just hard to capture because he uses a lot of names. He is an underground king who works dirty. He does not have a permanent address, his name changes every week. I knew that because the name Patate is never heard of. It was hard to track him. If he is caught, I would assume that it is a miracle from above. Tim, I know what you've been through. I also suffered a lot. My brother killed my wife and son. That is why I hated the name Patate throughout my life. I tried to hunt him, and intend to kill him. I just can't find him. I came to my senses and realized that I won't get something if I kill him, only a life in prison. Even if I kill him, I won't get my family back. Killing someone out of hate only brings more hate. Tim, I adopted you because you remind me a lot of my son. By adopting you, I thought it would remove your hatred because I was filling it with love. Tim, I'm almost seventy years old. Please, don't stress me out. Please, don't kill Crueger. Let real justice do the work.\" Repolio said, looking straight at Timmy's eyes.\n\nAfter the officers witnessed the drama, they arrested Crueger because they considered his confession as surrendering. Timmy realized no sooner that killing Crueger will not give him real justice. Timmy also realized that in the midst of his nothingness, there was something, or rather someone who was filling him with a love bigger than the universe. It was Repolio.\u00a0\n\nTimmy, a year later, finally caught Patate with his great skills as a detective. Crueger was sentenced to life in prison and Timmy was satisfied with what Crueger got. Timmy is a detective with great skills, in fact a successful one that he has solved many cases in just a year. Patate, one of the people whom he had caught was punished to life in prison as well. Even though Timmy thinks Patate needs more painful punishment, he was content about Patate's current situation. Now that he is doing great and bringing justice to the people, he is at his peak. Well, luckily he had his Papa Rep to begin with. He was happy about his life, he was happy that there was someone who filled the hole in his heart, his Papa Rep.\u00a0\n\n\"Doing a good job, son. Solving cases like you are the greatest detective the world has ever known. Repolio giggled.\n\n\"All thanks to you, Pa. My past was filled with horror, but it was also filled with love. Yesterday's nightmare was also a sweet dream because of you. When I was a poor kid having nothing, you were there. Your aid back then, your support, and your love brought me here. Look where I am now. It worked, Pa.\"",

        "Before I explain a series of events that unfolded this weekend, I should explain the contents of a core memory that I have from my childhood. When I was around 5, I was visiting my grandparents in Florida, and my older cousins took myself and my younger cousins out to mini golf and ice cream one night. The final hole of the mini golf course had a bullseye and a ramp to launch the ball into the bullseye, and if you landed the ball in the bullseye you could pick from a selection of stuffed animals/other prizes. Although I was terrible at mini golf, I somehow landed the ball in the bullseye and claimed my prize (a hippo with the name of the mini golf place printed on the side). After we turned in our putters, we walked across the street to the ice cream place and sat down at the picnic tables outside. My younger cousins and I began running around in the yard near the ice cream place and when my older cousins called us to head back to the car I forgot my hippo stuffed animal somewhere by the picnic tables. I never went back for it but that night became a core memory for me, for whatever reason. \n\nFast forward 14 years (this Saturday) and I am a freshman in college visiting a friends college in Connecticut. We began the night in his dorm, and after a few hours of drinking we decided to head to a frat on the other side of campus. At around 2am I needed to use the bathroom, but there was a line of about 5 people already waiting, so I walked out the back door and went on the side of the house next to the dumpster. As I\u2019m going, I notice a box of miscellaneous things sitting next to the dumpster, and one thing in particular catches my eye. It\u2019s a hippo stuffed animal, and upon pulling it out of the box, I realize it was from the same place I had won my hippo from. Just like the one I had lost, it had the name of the local mini golf place printed on the side. I was in utter disbelief.\n\nI know coincidences happen, but I had never experienced anything like this before. I asked around that night to find out who\u2019s it was, but wasn\u2019t able to find an answer before we headed back an hour later. Although it\u2019s unlikely, I think there\u2019s a chance I found the exact hippo I had lost 14 years prior.",

He got out of his chair and stood in front of me. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s see.\u201d He began his examination, starting with my eyes. \u201cHave you had any headaches?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean headaches from people or my injury?\u201d I winked at him, which won a small laugh.\n\n\u201cYou know what I mean. Although I will listen to either if you need to vent.\u201d I felt my cheeks heat. \n\n\u201cNo, I haven't had any headaches from the injury.\u201d *He\u2019s just being polite. Also, I can\u2019t really tell him why I\u2019m being bothered by these people.* I looked off to the side as he checked the back of my head. The top of my head was touching his chest. *He smells nice.*\n\n\u201cWhat about people?\u201d He stopped for a moment and sat back to look me in the eye. He waited patiently, sitting rather comfortably in his chair.\n\n\u201cWell, people are hard to deal with, but isn\u2019t it that way for everyone?\u201d I tried to brush it off. He stared at me, almost as if he\u2019s waiting for me to say more. \n\n\u201cWhere were you today?\u201d His question startled me, and I looked straight into his eyes. There was a hint of amusement there, but he looked serious.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere were you today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI could ask you the same question. Where were you today? Why did you come so late?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, I have a practice. I needed to attend to some other patients this morning.\u201d He smirked and leaned forward a bit. \u201cI answered your question. Now, where were you today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI went to the garden. Why?\u201d He walked over to me and got really close.\n\n\u201cFor one, you smell like flowers, and two\u2026\u201d He pulled a stick with leaves on it out of my hair and held it in front of my face. He twirled it a little and then took a few steps back when I reached for it. \u201cYou had this in your hair.\u201d My cheeks burned again, hotter than before. *What was that?* \u201cHow did that get in your hair? Did you climb through the bushes? Were you trying to avoid someone?\u201d He was laughing this time. *Well, he\u2019s not completely wrong. I hid in the clearing to avoid people.* \n\n\u201cIt was more to avoid people and not just one person.\u201d I chuckled awkwardly. He laughed even harder. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, for one, I didn\u2019t expect a noble to crawl through bushes to avoid social interaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t crawl through the bush! I was just leaning on the bush. I guess when I woke up the twig broke off in my hair.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou are definitely not like any nobility I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d He chuckled and tucked the twig in his bag. \u201cAnyway, you seem to be better! You shouldn\u2019t need any more examinations or anything. My recommendation is to not get hit on the head too often. It\u2019s pretty dangerous if it happens too many times!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you won\u2019t be coming here anymore?\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully not! Why do you plan on getting sick soon?\u201d He joked. \n\n\u201cWill I only see you if I\u2019m sick then?\u201d He stopped laughing.\n\n\u201cHey, I told you where my practice was\u2026 you can come by at any time. Whether it\u2019s for medical purposes or a social visit.\u201d He took a step forward and placed his hand on mine. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d His smile reached his eyes and his hand was warm.\n\n\u201cAlright, thank you.\u201d My face felt hot for the third time in such a short amount of time. I look away. *CHANGE THE TOPIC! CHANGE THE TOPIC! MY HEART CAN\u2019T HANDLE THIS!* \u201cWhat book were you reading yesterday?\u201d He pointed over to my nightstand.\n\n\u201cI was reading that one. I left it over there though.\u201d He pointed to the table on the opposite side of the room.\n\n\u201cAh, Mary and Lily must have thought that was one of the books I brought out. Where are they, by the way? Didn\u2019t father say they were to be here when you are here?\u201d I smirked at him and raise my eyebrows.\n\n\u201cFunny thing is, when I got here, you and your maids were nowhere to be found. Yesterday you said \u2018make yourself at home.\u2019 So that\u2019s what I did. I made myself at home.\u201d He smiled so sweetly, flashing his dimples at me, but when you looked in his eyes, there was a bit of mischief there. \u201cThen you walked in not long after I sat down. I was contemplating grabbing the book I started yesterday.\u201d \n\n\u201cAlright alright, I\u2019ll let it slide. Next time, though, you\u2019ll have to be more careful. You wouldn\u2019t want to be in a scandal with me.\u201d I joked.\n\n\u201cFirst, I would never kiss and run. If we were in a scandal you\u2019d be stuck with me.\u201d He winked, \u201cSecond, don\u2019t get to decide what I wouldn\u2019t want.\u201d He grabbed his bag and walked to the door as if nothing had happened. I stood there, flabbergasted. \u201cHave a nice evening Madam! I\u2019ll see you soon, hopefully!\u201d he called as he left the room.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I yelled after him, but he was already out of the room. \u201cYou cheeky little bastard!\u201d I laughed to myself. I sat on the couch and tried to read, but my mind could not tear itself away from what had just happened. \n\nIf this goes well, I may just be able to escape death! My plan was to get married\u2026 and Doctor Pruitt must have been flirting with me. If I married Doctor Pruitt, the hot, charismatic, young doctor, not only would I be able to escape my destiny as a villainess, but I would be lucky enough to actually like my husband! Hopefully, I can work him into my plan. If not, he\u2019s still a friend, and that\u2019s more than what I had previously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHI again! I'm proud to say I think I'm getting the hang of verb tense. I'm excited to hear what you think! The next update will be on Thursday the 28th! Until the next time :D",

        "A chill bit through Hanna\u2019s thin shawl. She wrapped it tighter around herself, brushing off errant leaves. Her head hurt and the world slightly spun. She put a slender hand on the trunk near her and took in the sight and smell of the forest. It didn\u2019t make sense. How did she get here? Her mind was a fog, but Hanna was sure it had been a beautiful spring day when she had come to pick mushrooms for dinner. Now, she hardly recognized where she was in this picturesque fall forest.\n\nA slight breeze ruffled orange and red leaves, scattering them to an already crowded forest floor. She had to get home; her new husband would be expecting her. They had barely been married a fortnight and Hanna wanted to impress Eoghan. She ruffled her damp skirts and marched on. If she was where she thought she was, her modest cottage should be just around the bend.\n\nMoving on wobbly legs, Hanna let her muscles do the work, her mind still spinning. Finally, after what felt like much too long, the dusty road appeared in front of her, her home village, the one she had lived in since she was born, sprawled out below her. The sight of the tall church steeple filled her heart. Whatever had happened, maybe just a horrible dream, must be coming to an end. With wobbly confidence she marched down the road, across the burbling brook, and down into her home.\n\n The sight of her blooming garden welcomed her, but it was, off. Her plants should just be sprouting, as she had planted them when she and Eoghan moved in after their wedding. But now, towering sunflowers and bright round full pumpkins filled the small space. She pushed it aside, eager to see her husband. Maybe she would rest and when she woke up all would make sense again. She lightly palpitated her head, could she have had a fall? Last winter old man Peter hit his head on his barn eaves and lost a full week from memory. Could that be it? No, It didn\u2019t feel right, Hanna was grasping at straws.\n\nShe approached her wooden door and before she could twist the handle, the door opened. Hanna bit back a gasp. She was staring at, herself. Tall with coiled auburn hair, a slender, pale face spattered with freckles. Hanna pinched her arm, hard. This had to be a dream. Worse, a nightmare.\n\n           \u201cMay I help you?\u201d she heard herself ask.\n\nHanna was speechless.\n\n           \u201cAre you quite alright? You look as though you\u2019ve had a fright.\u201d\n\n           \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026who are you?\u201d\n\n           The woman\u2019s eyes, her own eyes looking back at her, grew distrustful.\n\n           \u201cMy name is Hanna O\u2019Murray. Who are you?\u201d\n\n           \u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m Hanna O\u2019Murray. This is my house. What is going on?\u201d\n\n           The woman laughed, but the humor didn\u2019t reach her eyes.\n\n           \u201cYou must have taken a fall. Either that or you\u2019ve had too much ale before the Harvest\u2019s eve festival. I suggest you make your way back into town. My husband will be home soon, and he doesn\u2019t take too kindly to strangers.\u201d\n\n           Hanna, though in disbelief, felt anger and bewilderment stir inside of her.\n\n           \u201cYour husband?\u201d She almost shouted. \u201cLiar! This is my house and I don\u2019t know what sorcery or tomfoolery you are trying to pull here but I demand you leave at once.\u201d\n\n           The woman looked around, as though to make sure they were alone. When she turned back on Hanna her eyes had changed to a glowing yellow, her teeth grew long and sharp. Gently, she ran a clawed nail down Hanna\u2019s cheek.\n\n           \u201cMy dear, my sweet, sweet child. You have been missing for months. You would have been dead if I hadn\u2019t needed you alive to take your form. You were as good as lifeless from the moment I dropped you in that forest glen like a wet sack of sod. You simply do not exist anymore. I am Hanna O\u2019Murray and you are nothing.\u201d\n\n           Fear chilled Hanna\u2019s insides. \u201cI know what you are. You\u2019re a fairy. A changeling. But that\u2019s impossible, that\u2019s just a story my mam told me as a child. This\u2026this can\u2019t be real.\u201d\n\n           \u201cOh, it is. Now, begone before I change my mind and eat you.\u201d\n\n           Hanna felt rooted in place, fear, and anger keeping her tethered. Suddenly, the sound of a horse came rolling up.\n\n           \u201cHullo, dear! Are you ready for the harvest festival? I hear Kian grew a pumpkin the size of his sheep!\u201d\n\n           Eoghan, sweet Eoghan. Hanna felt tears well in her eyes when she looked at her husband. As he hopped off his horse and approached the house, his shining eyes changed to puzzlement. Hanna looked at the fairy to see her appearance had changed back.\n\n           \u201cEoghan, darling, this woman is sick. She is pretending to me be. She plans to kill me and be your wife.\u201d\n\n           Eoghan\u2019s dark eyes turned deadly as he rounded on Hanna. She had never seen such malice mar his face.\n\n           \u201cShe\u2019s lying! She\u2019s a fairy. Please, Eoghan, it\u2019s me, Hanna. Your real wife!\u201d\n\n           Eoghan looked back and forth from woman to woman.\n\n           \u201cEoghan, please kill her before she kills us! She\u2019s a demon! You know it\u2019s true.\u201d Pleaded the fairy.\n\n           Eoghan took out the slender knife he always carried with him. He looked back and forth. Hanna could tell he didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n           \u201cIt\u2019s me! I can prove it. We got married on March 15 in a tent in a beautiful flower field. All of our friends and family were there. It was the happiest day of our life.\u201d\n\n           \u201cDon\u2019t listen to that demon, she\u2019s tricking you! Kill her! Kill her now.\u201d\n\n           Then, the fairy began to speak an ancient language under her breath. A language long forgotten. Eoghan turned on Hanna, his knife raised high. The fairy\u2019s face turned ugly, saliva oozing from elongated teeth. Hanna met Eoghan\u2019s eyes, and she knew before she felt the knife slip into the soft flesh of her belly. Warm blood seeped through her hands. She was no more.",

        "My name is Jason, and I am human, or so I believe. The thoughts that persist lead me to believe otherwise. People often look at me and my mind conjures imaginings of their stares meaning. Is it judgment, do they like what they see, or is it they are disgusted by the product of my parents. I just need to stop focusing on those stares and continue walking. I just need to not think about what others think of me. All alone in my thoughts and the imagined thoughts of others in a symphony of never-ending madness that never ceases, until I\u2019m brought out of my madness by someone asking, \u201cYou okay, Jason?\u201d I awaken from the tar pit that is my thoughts and look at the person with an unexpected smile, and I say, \u201cI\u2019m good, thanks for asking.\u201d Another lie I have told when the constant of my ocean of thoughts floods me every second. I know it isn\u2019t normal to think as much or as harshly about oneself, but I am both my greatest friend and my own enemy. For I know the extent to which my mind dislikes me and also likes me immensely. It likes me when I do what is right in my eyes, and punishes me when I do anything wrong. I see the others of my peers and recognize our differences, and see I truly am an enigma. They laugh, joke, and play with one another, but I can\u2019t just simply interject because I don\u2019t understand nor share their interests, and the jokes would be too truthful for me to endure, and I don\u2019t understand when something goes too far, so I sit silently in those moments. My mind is anything other than quiet. \u201cWhat you need to do is just talk.\u201d When another thought chimes in saying,\u201d No, no, no you wouldn\u2019t want to make a fool of yourself, but what you really need to do is find a way to interject yourself into the moment.\u201d\nThen another thought speaks boasting, \u201d You know the boy isn\u2019t able to think on the spot about something he knows very little about, he can\u2019t truly engage with his peers, I mean look at him, the proof is in the pudding.\u201d By this time I begin tearing up outwardly. Another voice speaks out, \u201cLook what you\u2019ve gone and done making the baby cry, too bad the world forgot about those tears and their meaning long ago, what you need is something to take the edge off kid.\u201d\nI am visibly crying to the point of others seeing the tears streaming down my face. A few people are around me asking me an array of questions, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d \u201cDid something happen?\u201d \u201cPlease talk to us.\u201d \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d With that final question, I look up from my soggy expression and begin screaming outwardly through my tears, \u201cWhat I need is someone to talk to!\u201d I awaken from my daydream to find I\u2019m still sitting watching everyone talk, and I realize this was all a part of my dissociation. Then a voice in my head speaks,\u201d You can always talk to me Jason, whenever you need me, I\u2019m here. Always, and forever.\u201d I smile with teary eyes and begin approaching the group who is laughing and joking with one another, and I sit amongst them without saying anything, and one of them says out loud, \u201cHappy to see you here Jason, we were beginning to worry about you.\u201d I just silently sit, smile, and say, \u201cNo need to worry, I have everything I need.\u201d",

The room around them had been decorated for a human celebration of some sort, and they had asked permission to observe the decorations before the party began. They had been happily scooting around, taking notes on color schemes, when Twistunder\u2019s appendages had begun to itch. The ever helpful humans had provided them with the hydration tub. From there they could watch the bustle of the preparations.  \n\n\u201cThere should be no problems,\u201d Tumblesleft answered him. \u201cThere is almost no nutritional value in it, but it is primarily simple sugars.\u201d  \n\n\u201cThe guests should be arriving soon,\u201d a human holding a green canister called out. \u201cDo y\u2019all need anything before I go and get the cake thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a cake!\u201d yelled another human across the room.\n\n\u201cWe are fine,\u201d Twistunder assured him.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d the human said as his face flushed with the dancing lights of eager delight, \u201cwe were going to do the cake\u2014\u201d  \n\n\u201cNot a cake!\u201d the other human corrected again.\n\n\u201cOn that table over there,\u201d the human gestured towards the central table with the canister, \u201cbut since you little dudes are over here, I can do it right here in front of you. So you can see the colors better. You dudlets like colors, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do,\u201d Twistunder agreed eagerly. \u201cPlease do the cake\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a cake!\u201d the interruption came again.  \n\n\u201cIn front of us,\u201d Twistunder finished.  \n\n\u201cWill do, little bud!\u201d the human assured him as he turned and strode across the room.  \n\n\u201cWhat is he going to do to the not-a-cake?\u201d Tumblesleft asked.\n\n\u201cYou are the nutritional expert,\u201d Twistunder said, rippling in humor. \u201cBut there will be colors, and we do like colors.\u201d\n\nThey rubbed appendages in amusement and began to exchange greetings with the arriving humans. The pulsing of the human music started, and the lights began flashing wildly. The guests were chatting and eating the small foodstuffs provided for them. After some time, the first two humans reappeared, one still holding the canister and the other holding a glistening, sculpted dome of crystals. The lights normalized, and the music drifted to an end.  \n\n\u201cThose are pretty colors,\u201d Tumblesleft said with admiration in the set of his body.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the canister for?\u201d Twistunder suddenly asked as the humans approached.  \n\n\u201cWhy is that relevant?\u201d Tumblesleft asked.  \n\n\u201cIt now has a trigger mechanism attached to the exhaust end,\u201d Twistunder indicated with his gripping appendage.  \n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Tumblesleft asked absently as he pulled himself further out of the tub as the humans set the not-a-cake on the table, and the lights dimmed well below human tolerance ranges.  \n\n\u201cI think it would be safer underwater,\u201d Twistunder stated, matching his actions to his words as the canister trigger began clicking in time to the human\u2019s hand movements.  \n\n\u201cWhy do you\u2026\u201d Tumblesleft began.  \n\nWith a rushing sound, a spear of flame leapt from the canister trigger, and the humans made low sounds of approval.

        "\u201cDear God! What is that thing?!\u201d\n\nJimmy James was sitting on the front porch, sipping on a glass of alcohol in the December heat, when a shadowy figure approached him. The full moon shined upon a strange creature, skinny framed, with haunted black eyes and a long snout full of dust and filth. It wore khaki shorts and a faded green business suit, and on its head are two horns like lightning reaching for the sky. Jimmy sipped his cheap Mexican beer to ease his shaking nerves.\n\n\u201cPrepare for the end, prepare to meet the Deer God!\u201d The shadowy figure had a loud booming voice that echoed in the stillness over the trailer park at the edge of the city. It floated over Krill Street, where the statues of the town founders stood, past the old houses at Wolf\u2019s Lane that had burned with fiery red flames, past the empty playground where paint flaked off the metal slides, over Downtown where business used to thrive, down on the local soccer field where no foot would ever kick another ball. The Deer God\u2019s voice filled the town, \u201cNo refuge for the wicked\u201d.\n\nJimmy was on his feet, he didn\u2019t remember standing. He threw his bottle aside and turned away from the porch and reached for the front door. As soon as he twisted the knob halfway, the door locked itself shut.\n\n\u201cNo no no\u201d Jimmy slammed the door repeatedly. \u201cOpen up! Open up!\u201d\n\nDeer God extended its bony arms and flew towards the front porch, dragging the chains strapped to its body, leaving a trail of black rust as it moved across the dirty yard. Jimmy smacked the door even harder as the Deer God\u2019s icy breath sent shivers down his spine.\n\n\u201cPlease let me in!\u201d Jimmy begged as the Deer God touched the poor man\u2019s shoulders with its skeletal fingers.\n\n\u201cRepent\u201d whispered the Deer God into his ear.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me\u201d Jimmy pleaded. His body stood straight and stiff. He couldn\u2019t move his limbs even if he wanted to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be good, I swear!\u201d Jimmy prayed. \u201cPlease please plea----\u201d\n\nEverything fell silent.\n\nJimmy turned his sweaty head to see that there was no one there. Just an empty street lined with old trailers and flickering lamplights.\n\nJimmy walked down the porch steps towards his beer bottle in his front yard. He looked left and right before crouching down and grabbing the empty green glass. There\u2019s an old sticker on the bottle labeled \u201cNoche Anstlax Beer\u201d. Below the sticker is a list of ingredients faded beyond recognition. Was that real? Did his beer have LSD or something?\n\nJimmy heard the door slam wide open. A child with blonde hair and dark skin stepped onto the front porch.\n\n\u201cRandy! Get your ugly ass inside and fetch me another bottle!\u201d Jimmy shouted at the top of his lungs.\n\nThe kid scuttled back to the house. The clinking of bottles and empty flasks fill the silent air.  Jimmy stood up and walked back to the rundown shack he calls his home. He had already forgotten about the Deer God, and it\u2019s gonna come back the moment he takes another sip of \u201cNoche Anstlax Beer\u201d.",
        "Hi, i'm Micky. I'm an avid gamer, single, lives by myself, no pets. I enjoy my solitude, although I do enjoy a night out or two. Here's the dilemna. Something is up with this new apartment.   \nAnd I don't know what it is yet.  \nThis is the night of the moon event, a few days ago. I can't recall. I was hanging with a friend, we ate some food and got super baked and checked out the room. After a bit I head home. My parents are worried about my taking vitamins for my health. (I had to go see a cardiologist recently). Anyway, they said they were on the way.   \nI heard foot steps coming up my stair case. (I live in aparements. So each building has 4 apartments in it. I go look through my peep holel, I see nothing. Usually when they say they will be somewhere, after a while they show up. So i'm like alright, they're just slow playing at a store or something. I hear a faint knock at my door. I unlock the door and open it.\n\nAnd guess what I see? Nothing. Now i'm thinking that I smoke way too much and i'm trippin. Right?   \nI grab a michelob ultra and sip on it while i'm listening to some music on spotify. (I love glass animals).  \nI'm relaxing and my eyes start shutting.   \nI fell asleep, and woke up the next morning. No missed calls, no texts. (my mom is the type to text me anytime I get mail at her house.) So I thought that it was strange. My mom works nights, so i couldn't call her she'd be sleeping now.  \n\n\nSo I forget about it, until tonight. She acted as if nothing was said about them coming over at all.  \nAnd now they messaged me again saying they are on the way with my vitamins.  \nI am throughouly tripping.  \nI'm literally writing this while I wait for the knock.   \nAnd my dumb ass just smoked.",
        "So as a teen my mom and I were abused by my ex step dad. I wanted attention so badly and I felt like no one loved me. So I would lie to people to grab attention. I wanted to feel like someone cared about me. I never wanted to lie. I seriously didn't but it just happened. I never wanted to hurt anyone ether. I guess it was because I just was so  lonely and scared and I just really didn't know what to do. Please understand that everything is better and that I'm okay now and don't lie anymore",
        "The driver slowed his truck to a stop. He looked at the newspaper folded neatly on the passenger\u2019s seat, and let out a faint chuckle at the absurdity. He tucked it into his pocket, then climbed down with difficulty onto the pavement, his large belly bouncing with each step he took. He held up his hands to show he was unarmed.\n\nThe two men in baseball caps and face masks who were blocking the road stared at him, but came to the conclusion that he posed no threat. One put his pistol back into his pocket, and climbed up into the driver\u2019s seat, while the other pointed his pistol at the driver. The driver didn\u2019t seem to be worried. After all, this happened every now and then.\n\nThe one in the driver\u2019s seat started the truck again, and called out to his colleague, \u201cGet up.\u201d He brandished his pistol, pointing it at the driver again while his colleague got into the passenger\u2019s seat. Then they drove off, taking the truck full of distilled water. This change of guards took less than a minute.\n\nThe driver looked at the headlines again. \u201cChina refuses to release water into the Mekong, water prices rise tenfold\u201d. What an absurd world.\n\n\\----\n\nIn a cramped and dirty massage parlor, an auction was going on in the surprisingly spacious back. It was attended by all walks of life: lawyers in suits who just yesterday fought to jail a drug dealer, a grandmother hugging her five-year-old granddaughter tightly as they passed the corridor to the impromptu auction hall, a young college student too nervous to meet anybody\u2019s gaze. The seedy-looking men were on the dimly lit stage, surrounding the bottles of water placed delicately on the table.\n\n\u201cThirty five dollars!\u201d The lawyer shouted. The grandmother took out her purse, counting if she had enough money. US dollars were hard to come by, but these places weren\u2019t going to take Vietnamese dong. The little girl tugged at her clothes, wishing they were done already.\n\n\u201cThirty six!\u201d The director of national security in the police force belted out. He was a regular here, and hoped this would give him an advantage in the bidding war. If not, he could always arrest someone and take their water.\n\n\u201cThirty seven dollars!\u201d Countered a businessman in a pinstriped suit. He wiped his forehead with a silk handkerchief.\n\n\u201cThirty eight!\u201d The lawyer yelled back. For an auction, the host said relatively little, since all the talking was done by those in the audience.\n\nA bunch of men in baseball hats and face masks carried boxes of distilled water to the front, setting them down on the table as lightly as they could. The folding table creaked under the weight.\n\n\u201cThirty eight fifty!\u201d The grandmother shouted. \u201cThirty eight fifty!\u201d She was worried she couldn\u2019t be heard over all this chaos. How would the family cook then? Or drink? Or wash dishes, clothes, themselves\u2026\n\n\u201cForty two!\u201d The businessman yelled. He was not going to be outbid. He glared at the other participants, his face red and sweaty. His gold Rolex was misting over as he panted with effort and concentration.\n\n\u201cForty two once, forty two twice, sold!\u201d The host had his first lines of the day. The businessman came up and grabbed a 500mL bottle. Sure it was only a medium size, but this can probably last him through half a day. He clutched it in his arms, and walked down the aisle to leave in his Porsche.\n\nThe grandmother ran up and pounced on him, trying to pry the bottle from his hands. Both fell to the floor, still entangled as each tried to flail and yank the bottle away. He grasped the bottle tight and used his free left hand to push her away. \u201cGet off me, old hag!\u201d He screamed. As her legs hit a nearby chair, the grandmother yelped in pain, but didn\u2019t let go of the bottle. \u201cNever!\u201d\n\nThe lawyer and the director of national security looked on with interest, but none elected to get out of their chairs and intervene. It was not their fight.\n\nThe businessman shoved the grandmother again. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to your farm and use the river or stream? Leave my water alone!\u201d He said through gritted teeth. The grandmother let go of the bottle from her right hand to prop herself up, but maintained an iron grip on the bottle with her left. \u201cIt all dried up, why else would I be here? My whole family depends on this!\u201d She shrieked. She brought a knee up to the businessman\u2019s stomach, eliciting a loud groan. The little girl hid behind a chair, plugging her ears and closing her eyes shut, tears trickling down her face silently.\n\n\\----\n\nOutside, a young college student whispered into her phone with her hand covering her mouth. \u201cPlease, Mr. Xu. I\u2019ve known your daughter all these years. Please, sell us some water. I know you have contacts in your government. Just a few liters, not much. You\u2019ve dammed the whole Mekong river, now we\u2019re out of water. The least you can do is to sell me some.\u201d She stood on the corner of the street, eyes glancing over anyone walking near nervously. She hunched over instinctively, as if that made her invisible.\n\nShe was desperate not to enter the illegal massage parlor, having heard its reputation for years. Anything could happen there, and a young woman such as herself had every right to be worried about safety. She was close to tears just begging her best friend\u2019s father.\n\nA man in a face mask walked up behind her. \u201cAre you trying to buy water from somewhere other than us?\u201d He bellowed. He balled up his fist, and punched her squarely in the stomach. In pain, she doubled over, dropping her phone onto the boiling hot pavement. He knelt down and pocketed it, before leaving her lying defenseless on the street as he entered the massage parlor. Can\u2019t let people find other ways of getting water, he thought. People on the other side of the street made no effort to check if she was okay, or to help her up.\n\n\\----\n\nThinh Duc licked his parched lips. He was still third in line for this small shop that sold great spring rolls. He held his bottle of unopened distilled water close, like that could give him some relief for his thirst. The water sparkled in the sunlight, swishing around enticingly. He had to put his other hand in his pocket to stop himself from opening the bottle and drinking it all. He couldn\u2019t, because otherwise he had no way of paying the shopkeeper.\n\nThe people in front of him in the line were pouring water into a measuring jug to pay for their meals. That soft trickle only exacerbated his thirst. But his meal will come with some sauces, which should keep the thirst at bay. *A few more minutes. A few more minutes and I will have my sweet relief*.\n\nAt long last, it was his turn, and he stepped up to the cashier. \u201cA set B please,\u201d he said as he pointed to the menu. He didn\u2019t have to, since that was his regular order when he came every Thursday. The cashier pressed a few buttons on the register. \u201cFifty two US dollars please, or 580 mL.\u201d\n\n\u201c580? That guy only had to pay 575!\u201d Thinh Duc pointed to a man sitting in the far corner, wolfing down his spring rolls. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t try to scam me! It\u2019s all I have!\u201d\n\nThe cashier pointed at the radio. \u201cThe price of water reached a historic high for the third day in a row. As of now, 1L costs 89.62 dollars, and it is expected to rally further,\u201d said a voice coming from the radio. She grinned, since it is her husband\u2019s store. \u201cTalk more, and you might have to pay more. Any more complaints?\u201d\n\nThinh Duc suppressed his anger, and carefully poured his water into the measuring jug, making sure no drop was spilled and wasted. He screwed the top back on with force, hoping no molecule of water would evaporate and be lost. Taking his ticket, he sat down on a small table and waited for his spring rolls.\n\nThe radio continued playing. \u201cWelcome back to *New News is Good News*. China has announced plans to build three more dams over the Mekong river in the next decade. Droughts and water shortages are expected to become more common.\u201d\n\nThinh Duc groaned along with everyone else in the shop. *More dams? This wasn\u2019t enough already?* He shook his head, and mentally made a calculation to get to know the people in the massage parlor. He had a hunch he would have to go often, and being familiar and friendly might get him a small discount. Might have to join the gang.\n\n\\----\n\nFor more like this, please visit our sub r/RedTideStories or our blog on [64fd.wordpress.com](https://64fd.wordpress.com).",
        "      Yeah I know. I had my Reddit for a while but haven't really posted anything and reason why.... well I don't have one, I guess I was really thinking alot about what I should say for the very first time. And well I guess this is it huh? In all honesty though, I started to type what I felt right now is because my family is fucking crazy. One minute it's \"oh hello there son of mine\", to \"you fucking piece of shit that can't do anything right, get the fuck out and find a place for you instead \".\n      I know that I am a screw up of a son but I have feelings too you know? I just want to be loved the exact same way like my sisters but I guess that so much to ask. I told myself that if I ever had a kid of my own, I swear to God that I will love him or her more than my actual mom gave me. If they had a brother or sister,  I'm going to love them both the same way and be the best father than there ever was. But for now..... It's time to come back to reality and suffer more here for right now. I know in my heart, life will change soon for me.",
        "I've been out of school for 5 years now, but I honestly can't let go of the past... I've been holding onto my home and memories from double that time, think I'll forget school?  This will be relevant, don't worry. Hope this doesn't count as a wall of text just on the sheer fact of how much there is here.\n\nIn my remembering of those days, I decided to build my highschool in Minecraft and explore on VR. It's about 30% done, it's going... Anyways, I've been reliving hilarious or cringy moments in my head, so allow me to tell you some short stories.\n\nStory 1: Some time in October 2015, we had this weird.. singing thing... It was for some Halloween event. We weren't actually singing though, I was lip syncing, we'd choose our song and part, I chose \"This Love\" by Maroon 5 as it was my favorite song at the time. I set my name as my gross cringy 13 year old self's alias. Keeping that private cuz I used it as my YouTube name for a long time, and I'd rather stay somewhat anonymous from YouTube. Anyways, again... I get out into the gym where the event was happening, EVERY. SINGLE. STUDENT. TEACHER. JANITOR. ETC. We're lined.up on the bleachers, I just locked up as my song started, that was my first experience with stage fright. And it wasn't even a real performance. Suffice to say I lost by a lot lmao.\n\nStory 2: we were in the computer lab towards the end of May 2016, school was almost done, so the teachers were giving the throwaway free point assignments. For this one, we had to write the lyrics to a song, and pint out various terms that were being used, for example, one of them was \"highlight a line that demonstrates a metaphor\" stupid things that are really easy for a middle school/highschool student... Well. My song had the word \"hell\" in it, I was 13 and super into Undertale so I had chosen a fan song, you can probably guess which dialogue was being quotes if you know the game, but if not, the question I asked the teacher will give you all the context needed. In the confusion of if this line was acceptable, I asked the teacher, \"if it's being used referring to the place, can I write the word hell?\" She just kinda looked at me... I decided to change songs cuz I was embarrassed.\n\nStory 3: my science teacher liked me, I was a good student in his class, IDR what month this was, but it was sometime in 2015. Well, the class (excluding me and like 3 other people) were all being rambunctious. The teacher walks in and clearly had been having a bad day. He just kinda snapped and asked \"Come on guys, will you ever learn??\" The classroom went mostly quiet, I took that opportunity. \"probably not.\". With no pause, he says \"OP, go to the hall.\" He emerged a few minutes later, chuckled, told me what I said was funny, but that I shouldn't do stuff like that.\n\nThanks for reading. I'm bored. Feel free to say whatever. And if we went to the same school, I apologize for who I was back then lmfao!",
        "A boy gets up from his chair and gets his test results his score is 90 whereas the rest of his class gets various results both failing and passing.\n\nWhen school days ended he would run straight from the supermarket to buy groceries for dinner. He doesn't care about what he wants as he is distracted by other things such as his house, his family, chores and homework. \n\nHis mind is troubled by various things in his life and that is his home. His parents ignored their son's needs while they are paying attention to his three sisters which he is a quadruplet and he's the oldest of the quadruplets\n\nWhich in turn makes him very independent and does everything by himself he usually takes his sisters with him on the way home but there are times when  his sisters took the school bus and are already home so he dosent worry about going with them on the way home although it looks he needs help he dosent need anyone's help he does it by himself.\n\nWhen he gets home he goes straight to the kitchen to cook food for dinner, clean the house, and do other chores which he usually does so that he does something for the day at least.\n\nOnce dinner is ready he either waits for his parents to arrive or eat with his sisters first since they work mostly late he chose the latter and then he will cook for them once they arrived so that their foods are piping hot ready.\n\nHe usually has his own room while his sister shared their room since he is a boy and while his sisters are average in their grades he is somewhat smart but he dosent join at any school clubs because he's good at multiple things which is why he always has more free time to focus on house chores and homework.\n\nHe dosent want friends because he has work to do in his house and that he is very awkward socially so he usually stays away from people his age a lot and instead talk to mostly elders because its easier to talk to them and to just listen to their stories back in their younger days so he always enjoys them very much.\n\nBecause of his parents attention to his three younger sisters and him doing good at multiple things is why he is always independent but sometimes he just wants someone to stay with him but it's too embarrassing for him to say it so his days are always lonely but he's doing fine being alone.\n\n(end of episode 1)",
        "Reposting from r/casualconversations causeit got removed. Happened to me yesterday morning.\n\n I was having a cup of coffee relaxing after just cleaning when I hear some noises coming from outside and whatnot. I dont really pay attention to loud sounds as the walls are pretty thin in my neighborhood so every sound is decieving.\n\nBut anyways I go back to drinking my coffee and a few minutes later i get a knock on the door. Now because im Visually impaired it has made me a little paranoid because I cant see as much. I go to the door and politely ask who it is without opening it. (I never open the door for my own kids as they have keys and would let me know when their coming)\n\nBut anyway I ask who it is. A man answers back from behind the door telling me he's from a tree cutting service and is cutting my neighbor's trees down  behind me (I have neighbors in back beyond the fence) . He tells me that he wants to apologize for any noise he might make that might disturb me. Then he asks me do I want my trees in my yard cut?\n\nNow normally I wouldn't think much of it but for starter's my neighbors behind the fence dont have any trees in their backyard, l(Strike 1)\n\nNow i politely declined this man offer but he kept insisting about showing me his prices for tree cutting 11and insisted i open the door. I kept declining and he kept insisting (Strike 2)\n\nNow after the 5th time i declined this mans offer. He grumbles something under his breath and agrees to go away. I look out the window to get a good glimpse of him but I only see a partial image. (Again im Visually impaired and have trouble seeing certain thing)\n\nSo I try to go back to my coffee, Its cold so I go to the kitchen to heat it up. My backdoor is right in my kitchen. As im heating up my coffee, I hear someone try my door knob. Now I know i told y'all that the walls are thin and sounds can be deceiving but I distinctly heard someone try to open my back door.\n\nThen the unthinkable happens. I hear this man call me again and tells me to open the door. I tell him to go away. He goes away, only to try and open my side door now.\n\nNow people of reddit let me tell you, im an aging woman, after 3 kids, 1 breast reduction surgery,  and 1 too many oreos over the years im not in the best of shape (I got the body type of Garcia from Criminal Minds). But let me tell you, I did not think I could move that fast, I shot up those stairs, went to my bedroom slammed the door, grabbed my mini pistol alongside the phone and dialed all my kids as fast as i could. \n\nAs im calling my daughter I hear this man yelling at me to open the door while now trying to force it open. (Idk why none of my neighbors didnt call the cops)\n\nSo im behind my door poised to kill and finally after 10 minutes my daughter pulls up in my driveway. As she pulls up to confront him the man dashes from my back door and speds off down the street.\n\nMy daughter got a good enough glimsp of him to tell the police but for the most part he got away.\n\nThank you Jesus that is over. Before you guys ask I am ok but that was a little scary.",

        "I've got a bit of a weird, mysterious story to tell that happened to me a while back when I was on my laptop. It may or may not be interesting to you. But it sure creeps me out to this day.\n\nSo, about a year or two ago I was going through all my documents on Microsoft word and I found this document. It was a story. And since I write a lot of stories myself, I didn't think too much of it, as my documents on word are all over the place with all my different ideas and stories. (If you're a writer you'll probably understand). But it was titled 'Unexpected' and the way the story was written was like it had been rushed or generated even? It was unpunctuated and there were capital letters missing etc. The story also didn't make much sense. And the thing is I tried to make sense of it like - \"I'm sure I wrote this\" but it just wasn't in my style and I never remember writing it. But now on Word you can check the history of the document, so that's what I did and it says the document was written sometime in 2017. Which could be, although I just don't recall ever imagining or writing the story at all! And the characters names are slightly weird as well one is called 'Nella' which is a normal name but the other one is called 'Jok'. And I tried to research what the name Jok means and it's not even really a name, it apparently means something in Dutch but that meaning is 'joke' and the meanings made me feel a bit creeped out. Like was the reason behind the story to trick or prank me? And the story for some reason even though it's not too weird just gives me an unsettling feeling every time I read it, like I *know* I didn't write it, but I just can't seem to fathom how it appeared on my account.\n\nThe only possible explanation I can think of is that maybe my Microsoft account was hacked, which I did think happened since I had weird comments appearing on some of my old docs. But regardless it's still creepy and mysterious. And I still don't know who, what or why the person wrote it.\n\nSo, yep, that's my Mystery story which has been at the back of my mind ever since I discovered it probably 2 or 3 years ago. Thanks for reading my post!",
        "So I work at a Walmart in Utah as a cashier, I just needed to tell someone this I feel. This man who was clearly wasted or on drugs came into the store and started yelling at some of the stockers and had a huge stick with him. He then came into my line and started rambling to me about God or something and then pulled a knife on me, I panicked but my managers had already called the cops. \n  I only had to stand there for a couple minutes before the cops came in and started to talk him down but he was super angry and started yelling at the cops and pulled a gun on them. The cops yelled at him to get on the ground and then tazed him. Then he got arrested and taken out of the store. \n   I'm only 16 but I can't even tell my parents because they'll make me quit, thanks to anyone who read this",

        "At my HighSchool the theater program put on the production of Chicago and some random parent decided to call the school and say that \u201cChicago was to inappropriate for his sophomore\u201d so the school said that during school only juniors and seniors could watch the production because they \u201cdidn\u2019t want to traumatize anyone that is too young\u201d and everyone got so upset and refused to watch any of it (the more people who watched it the more money they got) so the school decided that after Chicago they would only put on child friendly shows. The next shows they did were the lion king and seussical the musical\u2026",
        "Now me and my friends where playing a game the basic thing was that the others beat you up. A kid wanted to play it with us so we did, many people got beated up with none crying. That one kid failed so we where gonna beat him up as that\u2019s how the game works, as we did he cried and ran to his mother and snitched, so after that his mother comes to me shouting at me telling me that I can\u2019t beat his kid up, I of course hold my own until my mom sees and comes so from that in turns into a fight and plus the mother says that the kid\u2019s neck broke and couldn\u2019t keep his neck up even tho when the kid was walking away his neck was way better than mine which didn\u2019t even take any damage anyway the kid was of course real dumb like his brother after that we go home and here I am posting it this happened an hour ago anyway thanks for listening to my story bye!",
        "\n\nThe life of being a loner eats away at my sole.\n\nNobody cares who you are, where you live or even if your alive.\n\nWhen I lose a job, I sometimes have to stay at a homeless shelter, which is nothing more than a haven for people with mental health and drug issues.\nI sometimes like to think I\u2019m better than them but at least the drug addicts talk to each other and the schizophrenics talk to themselves, where I have no one to talk with.\n\nI never grew out of my shyness and when my mother died, I had no one else in my life.\n\nI really have nothing to offer females.  There\u2019s nothing about me that says \u201cI want his baby.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m 5\u20195, balding, with a bad stutter.\n\nI sometimes think if you line up a bunch of really big Swiss cheese blocks, for some people all the holes will line up and they\u2019ll just walk right through them. For me, I wouldn\u2019t even be able to find a hole in the Swiss cheese.\n\nMaybe if I just would of stuck with wrestling, which is a good sport for short guys, then at least I would be an average guy, but now I\u2019m so exponentially distanced from even being considered average.\n\nHolidays don\u2019t mean anything to me other than during Christmas, where at least I can find seasonal work, However I can\u2019t even collect unemployment for the seasonal work, when I get laid off.\n\nI don\u2019t even know why I bother getting up most days.  I have little purpose other than figuring out where my next meal is coming from.\n\nToday is my last day working at a meat packing plant that I\u2019ve worked at for the past two months.  I met no one at the job and the only interaction I had was when my supervisor would tell me to hurry up.\n\nI get on the 69th street subway station which goes towards Frankford avenue, where I\u2019ve been renting a one bedroom apartment for $400 a month.\n\nThe train car is nearly empty at 5:00 pm. Fortunately, most muggers look at me and think that I\u2019m not even worth robbing.\n\nThere\u2019s a man whose well into his 80\u2019s, a woman a few years younger than him and a teenager, all in the same subway car as me.\n\nAs usual, none of us bother to interact amongst each other.\n\nAbout half way through the ride, the elderly man slumps forward and lands head first on the floor motionless.\n\nNone of us yell out, but\nthe older woman gets up out of her seat and assesses the motionless man.\n\nShe checks for his pulse and yells \u201che has no pulse!\u201d  She then points to me and the teenager and says \u201ccall 911!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t have a phone because I can\u2019t afford one so the teenager calls 911.\n\nThe train makes an emergency stop at the next station.  EMS gets on board and they assess the man, where I hear them say \u201che\u2019s dead!\u201d to each other, but protocol forced them to continue to do CPR and administer atropine until they get to the hospital.\n\nThey take the man off the train and the train resumes.\n\nThe two other passengers get off at their stops and I look around the car and realize that I\u2019m the only one left.\n\nAs I look around, I see what looks like a typed out report or a book under the seat, where the elderly man died.\n\nI pick up the untitled, typed out manuscript and read the first paragraph.  \u201cThis book details the life I lived, the crimes I committed, and the money I have hidden \u2026\u201d.\n\nI see the words \u201c \u2026 money I have hidden\u201d and I feel like I won the lottery.\n\nI decide to read a little more of the book \u201c \u2026 my father was a burnt out alcohol fueled WW1 veteran, who saw my mother and us kids as his physical and emotional punching bag \u2026 I was born during the depression and there would be some days that I didn\u2019t eat as a growing kid. \u2026 I turned to petty theft as a teenager \u2026 eventually my minor assaults had turned into murders.  I hid the stolen money in air vents and in basements of the peoples homes, I victimized.  I was married with kids and I didn\u2019t want to draw suspicion unto myself. \u2026\u201d\n\nSome of the things the guy has written seemed a little grandiose and illogical, like \u201c \u2026 I was the smartest and the best athlete in Philadelphia\u201d and how he hid the money in the people\u2019s homes he victimized all around Philadelphia.\n\nWhy would anyone want to return to the scene of a crime, especially if he murdered people in those homes? I think to myself.\n\nI think this manuscript is a fairwell to his children who seems like they mutually broke away from each other related to the \u201cabusive tendencies I learned from my father.\u201d\n\nThe guys name is \u201cFrank Maconelly\u201d and I think his intent was for his kids to read this manuscript and retrieve his \u201chidden treasure.\u201d\n\nHe listed some addresses of the homes and my stomach sank when I realized that they were in the most awful parts of Philadelphia.\n\nIf anyone has ever seen the movie \u201cRocky\u201d which was filmed in Philadelphia, they would see working class gritty neighborhoods.  However, those same neighborhoods are now stone cold ghettos that most people have no reason to drive through.\n\nI remember even hearing someone complain on the subway that \u201ceven my GPS knew not to take me through Kensington when Route-1 was closed.\n\nFrank used the words \u201clife changing money and jewelry\u201d when he referred to the places where he stashed the money.  Is he talking about life changing money in 1960\u2019s terms which might be $5,000 or is talking about five or six figures worth of money in each house? I think to myself.\n\nThis is by far the biggest thrill that I have ever had in my life.\n\nAs exciting as this adventure seems, this Frank character seems like he was a stoned cold murderer and quite frankly a serial killer, whose crimes were never linked together or to him.\n\nHe goes on to say that he remembered \u201cbegging \u2018these\u2019 people for food when he was a kid and they would look at me like a rat \u2026\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if he had targeted specific people or that he was trying to justify his murderous actions to his kids.\n\nThe really disturbing parts are  when he writes \u201cat first I tried to avoid killing children, however as time went on, I realized that they were giving the police descriptions of me, so I had no choice to kill them as well\u2026\u201d.\n\nWho would do such evil things and then go onto to write about it like he was justifying his actions? Why would you ever want anyone to know what you did and especially your own kids? I think to myself.\n\nThough I\u2019m a penniless loser, my mother did raise me to have scruples, so I\u2019m torn whether or not I should turn over this confessional manuscript to the police.  Another part of me, also thinks that I\u2019m committing a crime if I don\u2019t turn over this information to the police.\n\nThe thought of me looking forward to working at some retail store, when they start hiring for seasonal help, almost makes me throw up thinking how pathetic it is to be looking forward to making minimum wage.  \n\nI see one of the addresses is on Firth street in Kensington which is a few miles from where I rent now.  \n\nI\u2019m currently renting in the borderline neighborhood of Frankford, but just going a few blocks over to where Kensington begins is like the difference between Switzerland and Afghanistan.\n\nI keep telling myself that this will be my only and last opportunity to ever come across the potential of having money.\n\nI finally decide to put the manuscript in my backpack and go to my apartment to get my bike.\n\nI\u2019m having mixed emotions and  trepidation about casing out this home.\n\nI get on my laptop in my apartment and get the directions to Firth street.  \n\nJust getting on my 15 year old laptop and using my \u201cfree\u201d wifi that is as fast as Tony Soprano  running a marathon, I feel more justified to pursue this hidden money adventure.\n\n I start peddling towards firth street and already I see trash littered all over the streets and sidewalks.\n\nJust about everyone walking has a cigarette in their hands or In their mouths.\n\nI see crack addicted women, who barely resemble being human beings on every other block, willing to do anything for $5.\n\nRiding through this neighborhood is already making me change my mind.  I feel like I will get stopped by the police for being in this neighborhood, because they\u2019ll think I\u2019m looking for or selling drugs and then they\u2019ll discover my manuscript and I\u2019ll go to jail.\n\nThe sad part about this neighborhood is these Victorian looking homes are really run down but they have really good bones.  Whoever built these homes, put the extra effort in them to put in turret style windows and ornate siding.\n\nI could see how at one time people with money lived here, which validates more of Frank\u2019s manuscript.\n\nI finally get to Firth street and I\u2019m scared out of my mind.  I feel like I will be attacked by the gangs of young men who litter the streets or robbed by some crack fein.\n\nI arrive at the house Frank mentioned in his manuscript.  There is a group of adult men hanging out on the porch a couple houses down from this address of 1457 Firth Street.  For all I know, one of the men lives in this house that I\u2019m looking at.\n\nThe house definitely looks like someone with money lived here at one time, but now it looks like multiple people might live here, where one of the windows is boarded up with ply wood.\n\nI really stand out like a sore thumb, sitting on my bike looking at the house.\n\nA rough looking man comes out of 1457 and says \u201cwhat are you looking at?\u201d\n\nI really feel like a lost cowboy in Indian territory.\n\n\u201cUmm\u201d is the only thing I can say because I have no plan on how I was going to get into the house.\n\n\u201cYou looking for blow or for dust?\u201d  He then says to me.\n\nI really have no idea what either of those things are but I assume their drugs but I shake my head yes, regardless.\n\n\u201cYou got money?\u201d The guy asks me again.\n\nAnd I mumble out \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nThough I\u2019m a male, everything about my petrified demeanor is just welcoming this guy and everyone else to rob or even rape me.\n\nHe motions for me to come into the house, which I guess is a partial success.\n\nAccording to Frank\u2019s manuscript the hidden jewelry and cash was stowed away in the beams above the oil heater in the basement.\n\nI reluctantly walk slowly into the house.\n\nThe imminent threat of walking into what I\u2019m assuming is a crack house, made me forget that a man, woman and two children were murdered in this house. \n\nI  follow the guy and walk up the dilapidated steps and then I assume that I\u2019m supposed to follow the guy into the house.\n\nThe smell of filth and probably the decay of dead rodents seeps into my nostrils. \n\nI really feel like I should turn around and run away as I step on used hypodermic needles and every other imaginable type of debris on the floor.\n\n\u201cSo you want blow or dust?\u201d\n\nI try to think what will be the better of the two evils and I say \u201cdust.\u201d\n\n\u201c$20\u201d  he says to me in a stern voice.\n\nTypically, giving away $20 of my money would be like taking away a pacifier from a toddler, however I would probably give this guy whatever he wants in exchange for letting me live.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing you ain\u2019t got a pipe!\u201d He says to me in a pissed off tone.\n\nHe puts the \u201cdust\u201d in a pipe and lights it.\n\n\u201cHit it\u201d he tells me.\n\nI put the disgusting looking communal pipe into my mouth and I take a hit.\n\nI instantly get a rush to my head that I\u2019ve never experienced before.  I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a good feeling or a bad feeling but I feel like my brain is completely overloaded. \n\nI really can\u2019t stand up as the man starts to laugh at me.\n\nI lean against the wall and slide down to the floor.\n\nEverything seems like a blur to me as if I\u2019m hallucinating and dreaming at the same time.\n\nI see vague images of people rifling through my pockets and looking through my backpack for whatever valuables I have.\n\nI really start to freak out because I have no control over my body or my mind.\n\nI just lay on the ground motionless as drug addict after drug addict takes whatever I have.\n\nMy mind then pictures two little girls being chased around the house by a knife wielding man.  I can hear them screaming followed by the yells of their mother.\n\nI really just wish one of these drug addicts would just kill me as I can\u2019t take these images going on in my head anymore.\n\nMy mind then pictures this same family having dinner around a table, where Frank, who looks like a salesman is sitting with them.\n\nI picture Frank casually picking up his dinner knife and slitting the father\u2019s throat, followed by the yells of terror coming from the wife and the kids.\n\nMy chest and lungs start to move back and forth really fast as I start to hyperventilate.  Then my mind goes blank and I pass out.\n\nEventually I\u2019m awaken by some  guy pissing on me as I lay on the floor of the house.\n\nMy brain is so depleted that I don\u2019t even yell at the man to stop.  He finishes peeing and leaves the house. My jeans and sweatshirt are doused in piss and I have no idea how long I was passed out for.\n\nWhatever that \u201cdust\u201d was, has me feeling void of everything.  However, the reason for me being here slowly comes back and I force myself to stand up and look for the basement.\n\nI guess I kind of blend in more now that I\u2019m covered in piss and I have a drugged out look on my face, I think to myself.\n\nI see what looks like a basement door and I make my way slowly to the door.  I feel like I\u2019ve been beating up with baseball bats as it might be a possibility considering I have no idea what happened to me when I was passed out on the floor.\n\nI open the basement door and I say \u201coh God\u201d as I have no idea what awaits me.\n\nMy joints hurt so much, which allows me to only move in a slow pace down the stairs.\n\nThe basement is really dark where I can barely see anything as I walk down.\n\nGiving the fact that I\u2019m covered in piss and my whole body aches, I really don\u2019t care if someone or something tries to harm me.\n\nAs I get to the bottom of the steps,  I see three windows which are producing a small amount of faint light. \n\nI actually see a big oval metal container that looks like a submarine that I figure must be the oil tank that Frank mentioned in his manuscript.\n\nI hear rodents scurrying around, as I figure out how to get on top of the oil heater.\n\nWith no other means available, I awkwardly and painfully climb on top of the oil tank.\n\nAbove the oil tank, I see that there are three open areas where the horizontal wooden support beams meet the rock foundation of the house.\n\nTypically there would be no way in hell that I would reach into the dark open areas in between the beams, however all of my inhibitions have been taken away from overdosing and being pissed on.\n\nI reach as far as I could into the fist space and I pull out nothing more than what looks and feels like an old rats nest.\n\nI feel really disgusting, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from reaching into the second space.\n\nI feel nothing as I reach my arm as far as I could.\n\nI then go to the last open space and reach as far as I can, where I think to myself if there\u2019s nothing here, then I\u2019m just going to lay on this basement floor and let the rats eat me.\n\nI continued to reach as far as I can, then my finger tips feel something that feels like metal or something.\n\nI pull it out and what I see looks like an old WW2 ammunition metal container.\n\nMy brain is finally filled with some type of hope as I open this really heavy container.\n\n\u201cHoly crap\u201d I say out loud as I pull out a bar of gold that feels like it weighs close to a pound. I\u2019m astonished as I see that there\u2019s other jewelry as well in the container.\n\nThis is really a small fortune, I think to myself, as I can\u2019t stop smiling.\n\nThe whole container must way close to 40 pounds, which I stuff into my backpack.  \n\nI\u2019m surprised that I even see the manuscript that wasn\u2019t stolen, which is really nothing more than a macabre treasure map to me.\n\nThe metal container is too long, where I can\u2019t zipper up my backpack.  \n\nI look out the basement window and I don\u2019t see my bike.\n\n\u201cYou have to be kidding me!\u201d I say out loud as I have no idea how I\u2019m getting out of this neighborhood or even out of this house.",

        " \n\nI was simply preparing for another day of school, when an unexpected surprise hit, swift and shocking, like a speeding tennis ball.\n\n\u201cSteve, can you spare me a minute?\u201d Mom asked as I was stuffing my textbooks in my bag. \n\nA parent (or most adults for that matter) asking to talk was never a good sign. Perhaps a scolding for some stupid shenanigans. Or a sudden sort of tragedy. \n\nHowever, if anything, her expression confused me. She seemed quite excited but at the same time, a little hectic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving, Steve. Today.\u201d\n\nI was shocked. There were definitely previous conversations about moving out in the previous weeks (due to financial problems and such) but for something to come so quickly, was jarring to say the least. \n\n\u201cHow about school-\u201d  \n\u201cI already called the school. Needless to say, the principal understood.\u201d\n\nI sighed. This was going to be a pain. \n\nA good chunk of that day was spent packing, lots of cleaning, throwing things in boxes, throwing out a bunch of trash, donating, occasionally getting help from the neighbors. It was a damn miracle that it was done in 6 hours. But then again, I had no siblings. Lonely, sure, but less junk to take care of.  \n\nThe ride there was admittedly exciting, but also a lot to take in. \n\nMom continued to barrage with new changes and inconveniences that we as a family were to face, while Dad barely engaged in the conversation, simply keeping his eyes on the road.\n\nIf I were to summarize it would be -\n\n1. A long-ass bus ride to school\n2. The home was seemingly in the middle of nowhere, at least from what I perceived.\n3. My mom seemed more than quite excited. I mean, a lot of her free time was spent on looking at houses.\n\nBut as the familiar sights of malls, roads and neighborhoods were replaced with areas more foriegn, there was a feeling of uncertainty present. Fewer buildings and cars, with more trees and \n\nOn paper it was nothing negative, perhaps being homesick has kicked in a tad early? \n\nA good while I had passed, when the car finally stopped. In what I presumed was a house. It was definitely bigger than our previous place, that was for sure.  \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finally here\u201d Mom exclaimed, almost jumping in excitement. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have taken a world-class detective to discover that I didn\u2019t share the same enthusiasm. Well, looking on the bright side, at least the area seemed to resemble somewhat of a neighborhood. But for all I knew, the closest supermarket was an hour away.\n\n\u201cI am half expecting a pet cemetery to be around\u201d. I mumbled, and my Dad smirked. \u201cNow let\u2019s start moving things in before we change our minds, shall we?\u201d he replied jokingly. \n\nAnd thus the cycle of moving things began again. \n\nYet another few hours was spent moving things in, as I quickly dumped my things in my \u201cnew\u201d room. Soon after, I asked my Dad if I could go out to explore, and he nonchalantly replied with a yes. \n\nAfter all, even the most jaded of house movers were more than interested in exploring new terrain. \n\nEven if it wasn\u2019t a claim I couldn\u2019t back up with any substantial evidence.\n\nI didn\u2019t bother telling Mom. It was gonna get dark soon, and she tended to worry too much. \n\nI would be lying if I claimed there was nothing exceptional about the sight of pure, untamed wilderness. The calming sounds of the wind blowing softly, wildflowers, and the sounds of the birds chirping were quite a pleasant sight to behold. A feeling of comfort filled me.\n\nA feeling of comfort that I considered distracting, as low and behold, it was getting dark, and I probably walked a good hour into the forest. \n\n\u201cNow imagine if I found a cursed cabin or some unholy virus\u201d I muttered to myself jokingly.\n\nI turned away to walk back when I heard a twig snap.  \n\nI presumed it was nothing substantial, but I couldn\u2019t help looking back. \n\nI quickly scanned the area, looking at dozens upon dozens of trees, until something caught my eye.\n\nSomething odd.\n\nPeculiar.\n\nAnd quite frankly a being that shouldn\u2019t exist. \n\nI questioned my own eyes, as I took a step closer. \n\nOn top of one of the trees, was a small 7-inch or so dragon.\n\nAnd this was when my life took a strange turn, understandably. \n\nThe darkening forest was making things hard to see, yet still being able to distinguish that there was indeed a small dragon in the same realm I stood. \n\nI was already awestruck, my mind desperately scrambling to find a solution to the phenomenon in front of me. Was this some sort of mutated lizard? Or-\n\nThat\u2019s when it talked. \n\n\u201cOh, sorry. It\u2019s a tradition for humans to greet each other, right?\u201d   \nThat\u2019s when my mind raced to the only plausible explanation. Alien. \n\n\u201cThis must be really awkward. It\u2019s common knowledge amongst dragons that humans aren\u2019t exactly aware of our existence\u201d\n\nWhich I had just learned, was far from the truth.  \n\n\u201cGuess we can start with Introductions. I am Sherry. Dragon, in case there was any confusion.\u201d  \n\nAt least this supposed Dragon was polite. \n\n\u201cSteve. Human.\u201d I muttered. I was sure I would go insane if I tried to rationalize. \n\nJust go with the flaw. As strange as it sounds. \n\n\u201cWhere-What are you doing here?\u201d I blurted out. \n\n\u201cI would call it a vacation, but truth be told, I\u2019ve been away from home for a good 6 years. I guess research would suffice as an accurate term?\u201d\n\nWhere was I supposed to start? \n\nAs far as mythical creatures went, this so-called Sherry seemed casual.  \n\nBut all things considered, how was I supposed to react to this situation?\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t really blame that reaction, being all-what was it, dumbfounded? Guess things could have gone far worse. Unwanted publicity, a double-barreled gun\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou seem rather knowledgeable on our society, all things considered\u201d.    \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story\u201d she replied, still nonchalantly. \n\nPerhaps my curiosity was as obvious as the color of the sky. \n\n\u201cOkay. To put it simply, I ran into an interesting phoenix who spent a good 4 years teaching me all about human culture, a few languages from said human culture, and the somewhat helpful advice that being open as well as having a slight tinge of humor is a good way to charm people, regardless of whether you are part of the same species or not. Something I still haven\u2019t gotten quite the hang of, or confirmed the effectiveness of\u201d.\n\nThat may have sparked a million questions instead of solving any, but maybe some things were best left be. \n\nI looked at my watch. I needed to get back as soon as possible. \n\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know how to wrap up a meeting with the first known mythological creature, but I gotta get going.\u201d \n\n\u201cRight, of course. You probably have your own\u2026. routine and such. Just try to keep this whole encounter a secret. Couple people maximum, preferably not snitches. Not that it\u2019s too easy to tell.\u201d \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take it personally, but you are doing a pretty crappy job of keeping your existence a secret\u201d I replied. \u201cEver heard of stranger danger?\u201d \n\n\u201cI am good at reading people, well not people, usually, but I am sure you get the point\u201d.\n\nI didn\u2019t. \n\n\u201cWell, see you sometime soon. Sherry was it?\u201d I said slightly hesitantly, still trying to come to terms with all that happened.\n\n\u201cRight. Feel free to come by this area anytime.\u201d she said, \u201cpreferably, not a crowd.\u201d\n\nAnd that was how my first interaction with a dragon ended.\n\nOn the way home all I could think about was the peculiarity of the situation. But at the same time there was a sense of relief. Or excitement? Which was it? Or both? Perhaps I found the Dragon charming. After all, I never imagined a dragon to be casual, or much less talked. \n\nOr maybe I was just happy to make a friend. No, that\u2019s a stretch. Friends weren\u2019t made overnight, and it was built on a mutual agreement.  \n\nI opened the door, half expecting my Mom to scold me. Fortunately, no such thing happened, and before long I was munching on some chicken and mashed potatoes, one of my favorites. \n\nBut even as I munched on one of my favorite meals, my parents still seemed to notice me acting a little strange. \n\n\u201cDid something happen, Steve? You seem a bit jittery?\u201d Mom asked. \n\n\u201cHe probably met a cute girl or something\u201d Dad smirked.\n\nI sighed.  This was one topic Dad would never shut up about. \n\n\u201cGuess I could say I met a new neighbor,\u201d I said casually (or at least attempted to).\n\nMy parents kept asking questions but I simply responded most with a uncertain \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d with the occasional \u201cmaybe\u201d.\n\nThe topic eventually changed to my new schedule.\n\n\u201cSo back to school tomorrow, Steve. think you can handle the commute?\u201d\n\n\u201cFabulous\u201d I groaned. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so glum,\u201d Dad said reassuringly, \u201cIt would be like an adventure.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom 6:45 in the morning, every day. Count me out.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot like you have much of a choice, Steve\u201d Dad replied. \n\n\u201cSure, Dad,\u201d I murmured. \u201cBut I believe I still have the right to complain.\u201d  \n\n\u201cSteve, you will get used to it. Trust me.\u201d \n\nI shrugged. \n\nI always knew sleeping in a new room would be an awkward experience, but at least the place was tidy. \n\nFor Now. \n\nI jumped on the bed. Mentally going over everything that happened. \n\nMoving on such short notice would have always been quite a day, but the dragon\u2026\n\nIt was definitely a lot. \n\nYet sleep was still able to take me swiftly.",
        "This happened like ten minutes ago and I was able to laugh it off pretty quickly but hey what the fuck\n\nMe and my sis decided to go on a walk. We\u2019re both girls and older teenagers, round about 17. As we\u2019re heading back towards our house we see someone on a bike. He is barking like a dog.\n\nMe and my sis shrug it off. Man, furries have gotten wild these past few years, huh? The kid comes closer, I\u2019d peg him at around twelve, old enough to know what he was doing. \n\nHe keeps barking, but as he passes us he addresses us. Something like, \u201cyo, take off your hoodies!\u201d We didn\u2019t really react in any meaningful way, just kinda laughed at the kid and kept walking? Not sure what you\u2019re supposed to do if someone just rides up to you and says that and we didn\u2019t really know so.\n\nThe kid passes us, and is behind us. We keep walking. And then he passes us again and suddenly MY ASS HAS BEEN SLAPPED. Stung pretty bad. The kid just rode off as I was yelling at him. He kept barking.\n\nI cry easy and it was just so out of nowhere that I just teared up out of shock, but I\u2019m fine. Obviously not an okay thing to do but I think it\u2019s funny in a \u201cwhat the hell kid\u201d sense. That kid\u2019s gonna hit the wrong person someday and get put in the dirt and he will deserve it\n\nIt just happened so wanted to put it somewhere while it was still fairly fresh.",
        "As crazy as it sounds, this really happened. my brother was only 6, and I was 8. I said something to make my brother really mad. I don't remember what I said but it made him enter rage mode. crying in rage, he went to the kitchen to get a freaking knife. I screamed really loudly when I saw him running towards me, crying, swinging the knife around. He almost stabbed me but my mom heard my screams and stopped my little brother. I guess it was my fault, but I still can't believe I said something that'd make my brother want to kill me",
        "She doesn't realize that she never killed me, so I've been fucking with her since.",
        "Chapter 1 : Introductions\n\nWaking up, I had no idea how my life would change that day.\nWe had a college trip that day, so I had to wake up early, and get dressed. Soon, I set out for the daily bus, since my bike had a flat tire since a week now. \"You are gonna be late, Apollo!\", I could hear mom shouting from downstairs. \"Yeah, yeah, just the clothes are left\", I replied back. Mom murmered something, but I couldn't quite make out what it was. After packing up, I boarded the bus to Newtowns Garden. According to our plans, Kirlia and Brook would pick me up from there. They were my best friends since middle grade, and we were very close. I had a small crush on Kirlia, but that's just between you and me. Back to the story now.\nThe rest of the trip passed uneventfully. At last, I reached Newtowns Garden. Sure enough, I found both Brook and Kirlia standing there. Brook was enthusiastically waving his hand towards me. \n\"Sup' nerd!\"\n\"Brook, I'm not a nerd.\"\n\"But you ar-\"\n\nKirlia snapped in between.\n\"Cut it off, you two! Brook, man c'mon he just arrived. We can do this later okay?\", she said.\n\"Fine, fine, I'm sorry.\", Brook apologized.\n\"You packed your stuff?\"\n\"Yeah I did. Can we go now?\", I said.\nBrook went forward without us.\n\"Hey, Kirlia, uh thanks, I guess.\", I thanked Kirlia.\n\"No problem.\", she smiled.\nI stared into her eyes like a statue. Needless to say, she was looking beautiful today.\n\"You coming?\", she shouted after getting inside the cab.\nI broke out of my trance-like state and went after her.\nLittle did I know, that this trip would change my life...",
        "MY UNBELIEVABLE STORY:::: The feds are everywhere.\n\nThe cops are everywhere in the scene and I need to post this post to let people hear my story before anything else happens regarding this. I am gonna be upfront and honest about everything.\n\nHas anyone that comes on the vibe ever been to - house? I have been there a total of about three times - once last new years, once this new years and one other time.\n\nIt is a little house over off of the saint anthony main area with a gigantic indoor pool, a bunch of hot girls, a bunch of cocaine everywhere and a bunch ecsatcy...\n\nTHE WHOLE HOUSE AND EVERYTHING IS ONE BIG POLICE SETUP -\n\nSo here is the deal - After I went to BarFly for New Years I heard about an after party at - house (won't mention who exactly was the first one to tell me about it, but they know who they are). Now that I think back I can put everything together and I understand why it took so long to get out to the party, why there were such wierd vibes there, and why it took so long to get the cab to show up.....it took so long because they had to get a whole crew of cops together everytime I moved from point a to point b.\n\nI WANT TO START NAMING ALL OF THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE I THINK ARE INVOLVED AT THIS POINT BUT I AM NOT SURE THAT IT IS A GOOD IDEA YET---\n\nI met two asian dudes that claimed to work at Visage nightclub as door people and they started asking me a bunch of questions, asking about other people in the scene, just a bunch of weirdness now that I realized what is going on. Lets just say that I took a couple Ecstacy pills that I bought at - house and I was a little fucked up with my ex-girlfriend who was up from Texas for the holidays. We finally ended up wanting to leave around 10 or 11 am the next morning (Monday) so I called a cab from Blue and White to come pick me and my friend up so we could go home and get some well deserved sleep after a crazy new years....The asian dudes that supposedly worked at Visage said \"na na na, we can get you a cab from one of our good buddies that drives us around everywhere\"---the cab took forever to show up so I kept calling up Blue and White to see when it was gomnna come but they kept ignoring my calls....finally about an hour later the cab finally showed up and this is where I started figuring out that something very strange was going on.....I sensed something not right and in my head I just started freaking out.\n\nI either thought that\n\nA - I was setup and someone was trying to rob me.\n\nB - This is all fake and setup by the cops.\n\nMe and my friend Danielle get into the cab and the other two dudes that supposedly worked at Visage said that they were going the same way and wanted to ride along in the cab also - I hurried my friend danielle into the cab, shut and locked the door, and told the other dudes that they were gonna have to get a different cab but they were not riding in ours anywhere. My friend Danielle immediatly started getting pissed at me and saying \"what the fuck dude! They need a ride and you are gonna tell them they can't ride in the same cab!\" (she has no clue at this point what is going on).\n\nThe cab driver was a cop with a disguise on. I could sense right away that he was nervous as hell and I started observing stuff very carefully from this point on. He was wearing a little round head thing like an african would wear (not a turban). He just started talking a bunch of nonsense and he would not shut up....his accent also sounded really shitty....you know how you can look up front from the backseat of a car and see that really faded reflection of ther driver (kind of like a ghost image)---anyways I kept looking at the cab drivers eyes and I could totally tell that they did not match...he kept looking in his rear view mirror and was extremely nervous. It is at this point that I started leaning forward from the back to look at him closer. He was wearing a fake beard and it did not match his real mustache at all...he then scratched his head and his little round hat moved revealing a bald head with a line of fake hair that started towards the back!\n\nKeep in mind at this point that I have been up all night, was drinking a bunch of alcohol, and I took two pills which I bought at the house...You could say that I was a little messed up so I was freaking myself out wondering if this was really happening or if I was losing it....Once I realized that the dude had a disguise on it still did not click right away that this was the police - I kept thinking it was a setup for some reason and I was gonna get robbed....all I knew was that I was riding in a cab with a dude that had a disguise on and looked really nervous. - right when I realized this I was basically having a panic attack.\n\nWe sit there for about ten minutes and I keep telling her how I think - house is all one big setup..finally we start heading back out the front door towards the big gates that are in front of Panera Bread. As we leave I realize how many people are posted up out on the street watching me and I turn around, go back into Panera Bread and order a soup and a sandwich so we could sit back down - I don't know if the people working there were cops or regular employees but I could basically see that everyone in the place was focused on almost as if I was the star of the show.\n\nI got my food, walked through the place and sat down by the back entrance that leads into the mall hallway. I finally put it all together and it clicked - - even more when I looked up at the dude sitting across from me eating and realized that he had a channel four logo embroidered on his polo shirt, had a press pass around his neck, and was wearing a microphone pack clipped to his belt with a wire I could see - He was not supposed to take off his coat but he screwed up I stared this dude down for five minutes straight and he never looked up at me once. He was sweating bullets and everyone in the place was starting to show different looks on thier face.\n\nWEN IT FINALLY CLICKED IN AND ALL CAME TOGETHER I WAS SO SCARED THAT I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I SHOULD DO. I tried using both of my cell phones (my personal one and my info line one that I use for text messaging) but I could not get a signal on either one of them for some reason. (I am pretty sure they were jamming the signal).\n\nI stood up and said out loud \"what the fuck are you guys trying to do to me!\", \"do you think I sell drugs? Because I don't !\"\n\nI then walked over to an older looking guy who was sitting at a corner table with a lady because he was the one who looked in charge....I went over, sat down, introduced myselfand said very loudly \"well it seems to me that you are the guy in charge here running this show so I figured I would come talk to you\"\n\nYOU SHOULD HAVE SEEn EVERYONES FACES INSIDE THE PLACE - they all had the look of absolute disbelief on thier face and were looking at each other with the look of shock on thier face. This was indeed one of the big wigs with the feds.\n\nI sat down and started talking to him and the lady he was with. I asked him if just because I like electronic music and throw parties if that means that I must be hooked up with selling drugs. I looked him staright in the eye and said \"I swear to god on my grandpas grave and on the grave of my friend who got killed in Iraq that I do not sell drugs\" I started telling him how much work and effort I put into all of my shows and I even pulled out my phone and showed him the phone flyer for Darude I put together - I told him how much time and effort I put into my shows\n\nFinally the 'security guard' who was sitting out at the desk came in and told me that I was gonna have to leave the place or I was gonna get arrested. I walked out into the mall hallway and started talking to him at the security desk. HE KEPT SAYING THE WEIRDEST SHIT EVER I GUARANTEE THAT ALL OF IT WAS BEING RECORDED. He started rattling off names of people in the scene and was asking me if I knew them.....they were setting up questions and trying to get me to say certain things now that there cover was blown. I know for a fact that this dude had a piece in his ear and someone else was telling him what to say.\n\nIt was at this point that I asked to use the phone so that I could call a lawyer and they would not let me. My cell phones would not work and they would not give me a phonebook so that I could look up a lawyers number. I called up my mom and tried to explain what was going on to her even though it would sound like I was delusional and paranoid. After I start telling her stuff the fake ecurity guard who was really a cop or an informant for the government got on the phone and told my mom that I needed help and that I have been up for five days on Meth and was starting to lose my mind - none of which was true. I told my mom that I needed her to call a lawyer and contact someone in the media so that I would have some independant witnesses to what was going on. THEY WERE RECORDING ME AND THE DUDE KEPT SAYING REALLY WEIRD SHIT TRYING TO GET ME TO ANSWER BACK THINGS THAT THEY WANTED ME TO SAY.\n\nOTHER THINGS I NOTICED -\n\nI was looking out the window and I kept seeing the same people walking back and forth.\n\nThere was a black guy in a blue cap that kept walking back and forth. There was a guy in a green coat that keptgoing back and forth to the garbage can outside for no reason. There were two\u00a0different people sitting in Panera Bread with computers. Everyone was completely out of place---especially considering that this is New Years Day we are talking about. Don't forget about the Channel Four guy with his microphone pack on either.\n\nI ended up going to Chevys and eating because I still wanted to be in a public place and all of the same people followed me over there but they were all dressed differently. I ate at Chevys before the Darude show and I was talking to a couple cool guys there - I walked in and saw the same younger looking black dude I was talking to a day earlier and I said to him \"ok dude, I have to tell you some crazy shit that is going on because I need someone to hear this story and I proceeded to tell him everything\"\n\nI do not know if I am trying to be framed to make it look like I was doing something I was not or what exactly all of this was happening for but it happened.\n\nI will be meeting with my lawyer tomorrow to go over all of this and figure out what exactly I need to do from here....\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTO THE FBI AND ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT WILL READ THIS - you guys suck at undercover work.\n\nTo Channel Four News - ha ha ha you dumbfucks. I bet that stupid ass guy who was wearing the mic is catching a little heat huh?\n\nTo all of the snitches - Everyone will soon know who you are.\n\nI ALREADY KNOW WHO YOU ARE (at least two of them)\n\nTo all my friends in the scene - BE CAREFUL AND DON'T TRUST ANYBODY\n\nI DO NOT SELL DRUGS - sorry....i just like to party.",
        "\nI inherited a summer camp, that has been passed down from my great grandparents, in a small wooded area in Wyoming.\n\nThe camp has eight cabins, where each cabin can hold up to ten people.\n\nI rent out the camp to special needs people for about half of the year and the camp lays dormant for most of the fall and winter months, unless I can find someone to lease it out to.\n\nThe upkeep of the camp is almost impossible because almost everything was built in the early 1900\u2019s to include the cabins and the plumbing.\n\nWhen it comes to leasing the camp during the colder months, I try to sell the classic rustic charm of the camp.  However, most people just see a run down complex that doesn\u2019t look appealing.\n\nI just incurred a major expense from updating our underground electrical system that my grandfather installed sometime in the 1950\u2019s.\nI have two full time maintenance men but I had to hire surveyors and electricians, which cost close to $200,000 to dig up the old wires and install new ones.\n\nWith the mounting expenses, there is no way that I\u2019m going to be able to pay the taxes without having leasing groups at the camp for the fall and winter months.\n\nI will get an inquiry every few days to rent out a few of the cabins for a weekend, but the $500 Isn\u2019t worth my time and energy.\n\nHowever, about an hour ago, I might have found the potential leasing group that I\u2019m in dire need of.\n\nI had rented out the camp to this group a couple of winters ago, for a week, and I didn\u2019t have any issues with them.  In fact, they required very little time and resources from me and my maintenance staff.\n\nThe potential leasing group has roots from India, where their a unique blend of blended Catholics and Hindu\u2019s who formed a religion known as Acharya.\n\nThe contact person of the group, Singh said that they would bring the maximum amount of people, which is 80 where they would spend two weeks fasting and praying.\n\nThem not using the kitchen is an ideal situation because I can keep the kitchen closed and not worry about stocking food and other supplies.\n\nOne of my maintenance guys, Max lives in an old house from the late 1800\u2019s that\u2019s on my property and the other maintenance guy, Bill lives within 20 minutes, so between the two of them, they should be fine if any maintenance issues arise.\n\nI met Singh on Friday evening and I toured him around the campus.  He seems like a genuinely nice guy who has sponsored countless Indian families in America over the past decade.\n\nThe remainder of the leasing group will arrive on Saturday morning, where Singh said that he felt comfortable with the layout of the camp and who to contact, if there\u2019s an emergency, which is me.\n\nBeing a single woman, most days I just want to sell the camp and the property, but I promised my family that I would try to keep the tradition going.  I haven\u2019t had much luck dating guys, who typically run off when they realize the commitment of running this camp.  I even tried dating females and learned that dating women really isn\u2019t my cup of tea.\n\nMy house is located a mile away from the camp, so at least I have some separation from my home life and work.\n\nSaturday morning arrives and Max texted me that the leasing group arrived with no real issues.\n\nSince no problems had arisen, I went shopping in a quaint village not far from my house, where I picked up some festive thanksgiving ornaments.\n\nI\u2019m glad that I have Max and Bill available, where I really don\u2019t have to do anything.\n\nI chatted online with some potential flings tonight and had two glasses of wine.\n\nThis morning is Sunday, where I wake up and automatically check my phone to see if there\u2019s any pressing issues.\n\n\u201cWow! Nothing\u201d I say out loud to myself, as I see I don\u2019t have any missed calls or texts.\n\nSunday, I spend most of the day having football on as background noise, where I do some tidying up around the house.\n\nI end the day with chatting online with some of my male friends, where I set up for one of them to come over on Monday.\n\nI fall asleep again tonight by drinking wine.  I wake up Monday, where I really like seeing that there\u2019s still no issues at the camp.\n\nI send separate texts to Max and to Singh, where they both assure me that everything is fine.\n\nMy male friend, Dan stops by on Monday night, where we watch football and I slap his hands away each time he gets too playfully aggressive with me.  \n\nHe wants to sleep over, but I convince him to leave for the night.\n\nTuesday morning, everything is still going great, where I\u2019m having second thoughts of ever wanting to sell this camp, because when everything goes the way it\u2019s supposed to, then it\u2019s really easy money.\n\nWednesday, Thursday and Friday are blissfully peaceful, where I enjoyed doing nothing more than relaxing around my house.\n\nThis definitely sets a record for the most consecutive days of not having plumbing issues at the camp that requires calling an outside plumbing company.\n\nI guess this is how a CEO of a large corporation operates, where she just lets things fall into place and let\u2019s her underlings take care of all the pressing issues, where typically it\u2019s the opposite for me, where they\u2019ll be a leak in one of the cabin\u2019s roof and I have to wake up at 2:00 a.m. and figure out what to do.\n\nSunday morning rolls around and I send out another text to Singh and Max.  I get a response that everything is fine from the both of them, but something is a little odd in Max\u2019s response.\n\nMax responded \u201ceverything is going great at the camp.  Minor issues that were quickly dealt with. I will let you know if anything arises.\n\ntheek\u201d\n\nI noticed the word \u201ctheek\u201d at first and thought that Max probably accidentally misspelled a word and instead of erasing the word he accidentally pushed  it forward.\n\nThen, because I really didn\u2019t have anything else to do, I studied his text closer and said to myself that there\u2019s not even a word that starts with the letter \u201ct\u201d in his text or anything that resembles the word \u201ctheek\u201d.\n\nJust for the heck of it, I put \u201ctheek\u201d into Google and discovered the word means \u201cokay\u201d in Hindi. \n\nMax is a talker and the most logical explanation would be that Max was talking to Singh or someone else from the leasing group and they taught  Max the word which he thought about using.\n\nJust for the heck of it, I called Max.  The phone rang and rang and eventually went to voicemail, where I left him a message to call me back.\n\nI waited an hour and called Max again and I still got no answer\n\nI was starting to get concerned, then I got a message that read \u201cSorry Jocelyn  for missing your phone call \u2026\u201d\n\nOnce again, I\u2019m stuck looking at the text, where Max and most other people call me \u201cJo\u201d.\nI think maybe Max is being passive aggressive by calling me by my full name, but I can\u2019t dismiss the fact that he tries to call me all the time.  So much so, that I have joked around with him in the past and called him more than a woman than I am for his wanting to talk versus texting.\n\nI was going to have Bill cut the grass, so I reached out to Bill and asked him to cut the grass on Monday and then call me when he\u2019s done.\n\nI thought about stopping by the camp, but I learned from past experiences that leasing groups tend to overly complain about small things when they see me.\n\nIt\u2019s now Monday morning and I know that it takes sometimes more than eight hours to cut the grass at camp, so I don\u2019t expect to hear from Bill until later on.\n\n5:00 p.m. rolls around and I don\u2019t hear from Bill as I expected that I would, so I call Bill and it goes straight to voicemail.  \n\n\u201cOh crap something\u2019s wrong!\u201d I blurt out.\n\nI\u2019m starting to get a bad vibe, because I\u2019m not hearing from Bill or Max.\n\nI call Bill again it goes straight to voicemail.\n\n20 minutes later, I get a text from Bill\u2019s number saying that \u201ceverything is fine \u2026 \u201c.\n\nPart of me is thinking to let sleeping dogs lie and another part of me is starting to get paranoid.\n\nI know I won\u2019t be able to sleep tonight, so I decide to take the drive over to camp.\n\nI think about calling the police, but I don\u2019t won\u2019t any bad publicity being attached to my camp.\n\nI don\u2019t won\u2019t to be seen driving into the camp by the leasing group.\n\nThere\u2019s a walking trail that leads into the camp, if I park my car on road, so that\u2019s what I decide to do.\n\nI never had a situation like this before, where two of my maintenance employees won\u2019t call and talk to me.\n\nAs I walk closer to the camp, I see Bill\u2019s car parked in the general parking lot and I see Max\u2019s car parked by the old house.\n\nI\u2019m really starting to get a bad vibe about this current situation.\n\nI try to be as quiet as possible and walk towards a cabin that is dimly lit.\n\nI still have about 50 yards to go before I reach the cabin.\n\nI don\u2019t know where Singh is, but I assume he is one of the eight cabins.  The weather is in the low 40\u2019s tonight, so I figure it\u2019s doubtful that people are outside the cabins.\n\nI make my way to the lit up cabin\u2019s window.  \n\nI look into the window and my eyes try to figure out what I\u2019m seeing.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d I whisper to myself, as I see 10 kids that look to be anywhere from ten years old to thirteen years old laying miserably in their beds.\n\nI see this weird religious paraphernalia around the door to the cabin and around the two windows as well.\n\nThe kids are still awake as I see them tossing and turning.\n\n\u201cAre they being starved to death?\u201d  I blurt out to myself.\n\nI really start to get nervous now as I start to realize that something really heinous is going on.\n\nI wish I knew what happened to my maintenance guys, because I could really use their help right now.\n\nIf I call the police, then anytime someone does a Google search on my camp, they will see a reference to kids being abused, while being on my property, then no one will ever lease out my camp again. I think to myself.\n\nI just want Singh to leave my camp with the rest of his group.\n\nI feel really bad for these kids in this cabin, but I don\u2019t know if this is some kind of weird religious ritual, where the kids have to fast or something.\n\nThe worst religious thing I had to do was not eat meat on Fridays as a kid during Easter.  I know that Jewish people fast during Yom Kippur but that is only about a day or so, where these kids in this cabin look like their being starved to death.\n\nI\u2019ve met people from India over the years and I was never aware of any type of sick religious ritual like this.\n\nI want to see what else is going on in the other cabins as I tip toe to the next one.\n\nThere are no lights on so I rely on the moonlight to peak through the window.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I blurt out, as I can see a similar image of kids suffering in their beds with the same religious paraphernalia surrounding the doors and the windows. \n\nI slowly tip toe around each cabin, where I nearly have a heart attack each time I step on a twig.\n\nOf the remaining cabins all but one of them are filled with kids that look like there being starved to death.  The other cabin has 10 adults that are sleeping, where one of the adults is Singh.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if Max and Bill saw what I\u2019m seeing regarding the starving children and the adults did something malicious to the two of them?\n\nI slowly walk to my administrative cabin.\n\nI get to the cabin and sit on the ground and lean my back against the cabin.  I can\u2019t stop crying, because I feel so overwhelmed with everything.\n\nI feel like a real dirtbag for not calling the police, but I would be committing financial suicide if I do that.\n\nI try to rationalize my inactions by thinking that my camp has nothing to do with this, as Singh and his group of adults would have done this somewhere else to the kids.\n\nTime drags on as I sit out in this near freezing weather.\n\nThe only logical place I could think where Max would be is in the old blue house on the camp\u2019s property.\n\nAs the morning light starts to come out, I decide to walk to the old blue house.\n\nThere are no lights on as I approach the house, with Max\u2019s car parked out front.\n\nI have made it a point not to walk into this house uninvited in the past, because I see it as Max\u2019s home, but since he won\u2019t answer his phone or the door when I knock, I\u2019m giving no other option than to open the door with my spare key.\n\nI walk into the house and I don\u2019t see any signs of Max or Bill.\n\nI say \u201cMax\u201d out loud over and over again as I approach his room, with no answer.  I see that his bedroom is empty.\n\nThe whole house is empty, so I decide to go into the basement.\n\nI really hate going into this basement during normal circumstances because it\u2019s dark and creepy and with all of this weird stuff going on with this leasing group just exacerbates my feelings.\n\nI put my phone\u2019s flashlight on and walk into the basement via the old wooden stairs.\n\nRight away I see Max and Bill laid out on the basement floor.\n\n\u201cOh fuck!\u201d I blurt out as I hope the both of them aren\u2019t dead.\n\nBill is the closest to me as I come down the steps, so I shake him and say \u201cBill, Bill wake up!\u201d\n\nHe starts to come around the more I shake him and he eventually says \u201cwhere am I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour in the basement of the old blue house.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did I get here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! I tried calling you last night but you never answered. I saw that you or Max cut the grass.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! I cut the grass yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat nice man, Singh, from the leasing group brought me a cup of soda.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think he spiked your beverage with something?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously!\u201d\n\nBill starts to sit up and then he stands up.  He looks a little shaky on his feet but he is able to stand on his own.\n\nWe both go over to Max and lightly shake him.\n\nHe too starts to come around.\n\n\u201cMax are you okay?\u201d I ask him.\n\n\u201cHow the hell did I get down here?\u201d He says.\n\nBill and I shrug our shoulders.\n\nMax then says \u201cI really have no idea! The last thing I remember is talking to that Singh guy about what the hell he was doing with those kids in the cabins.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you remember seeing in the cabins?\u201d I ask him.\n\n\u201cYou know it was really an odd sight, where I remember seeing weird religious crap in the cabins with the kids wandering around aimlessly in the cabins.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you go inside the cabins or look through the windows?\u201d\n\n\u201cI looked through the windows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat made you look through the windows?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just thought it was odd that it was the middle of the day and no one was outside!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the last thing you remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was standing by the window of cabin number five and that guy Singh came up to me.  I asked him what was the story of these kids and I don\u2019t remember anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think he injected you with something?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook we need to get this leasing group off this camp\u2019s property.  Let\u2019s go and give those kids some cookies and juice before Singh and the rest of the adults wake up.\u201d\n\nBoth Max and Bill agreed, so we hurried to the dining hall and took as many cookies and juices, that I had in stock and rushed them to the cabins.\n\nWe started at cabin number eight, where Max handed out the cookies and I gave them boxed juices.  Bill concentrated on removing all the creepy religious paraphernalia.  I take a look at the religious stuff and I see graphic motifs of Jesus nailed to the cross and that Hindu deity that has multiple arms.\n\nWe cover all the cabins in a quick amount of time as we finish giving juice and cookies to the last cabins of kids.  \n\nI give out the last juice box as Bill removes the last of the religious paraphernalia.  All of the kids rush out of the cabin, which I figured was from the  sugar from the juice and the cookies, which gave them energy that the kids needed.\n\n\u201cThis has to be the worst case of widespread child abuse that has occurred in the United States!\u201d  I say to Max and Bill.\n\n\u201cI know! I can\u2019t believe what scumbags Singh and the rest of those adults are!\u201d Bill says.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and see if those kids need anything!\u201d Max says.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t the two of you guys go.  I just want to call my father to see if I should call our lawyer or the police.\u201d\n\nThe two guys leave the cabin to see if the kids need any help.\n\nI proceed to call my father, whose initial instinct was to call the police, but then we talked it over and we decided that it\u2019s best to call our lawyer first.\n\nI search through my phone and find the number for Robonowitz & Robonowitz Esq. who charges me $150 an hour as a consultation fee.\n\nAs I start to dial the number I hear someone quickly approaching the cabin, that I\u2019m in.\n\n\u201cOh my God, what have you done?\u201d Singh says to me as he barges through the cabin door.\n\n\u201cYou look here, you son of a bitch! You were starving those  kids and you drugged my two employees!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they would have minded their own business then they wouldn\u2019t of gotten drugged!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy the Fuck were you starving those kids?\u201d\n\n\u201cLiving in Wyoming, all you know is your own little world. You have no idea what kind of evil is generated when you live in pure squalor with no type of Governmental safety nets for the past hundreds of years!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I ask Singh.\n\n\u201cLook out the window!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d I say in sheer horror.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are those kids doing? Are they eating a raw deer?\u201d I ask.\n\nSingh comes to the window and points to what I\u2019m seeing and says \u201cYes, they caught a deer and now their eating it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bastard! You turned those kids into Neanderthals!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow take a look out of the other window.\u201d Singh says to me. \n\nI walk over to the other window and squint my eyes, because I really can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m seeing.\n\nI look over at Singh and see that he\u2019s nonchalantly putting back up the religious motives up on the door and on the other window.\n\nI\u2019m still so shocked that I can\u2019t talk.\n\nAfter a few moments, I regain some of my composure and say \u201care those kids eating \u201cMax and Bill?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Singh responds, as if nothing out of the ordinary is happening.\n\nI look out the window again and see the kids rushing towards the cabin.\n\n\u201cYou better hurry up and put up the motifs around that window.\u201d Singh says to me.\n\nI frantically rush to put everything back up around the window.\n\nI look out the window again and I see what looks like at least 60 aggressively looking kids stopped around our cabin.\n\nThey look like a herd of hyaenas that have a wounded lion trapped in the corner.\n\n\u201cAre these religious motifs, stopping these \u2018kids\u2019 from coming back in.\n\n\u201cYes, the same way how they were stopping them from going out!\u201d",
        "Birney Elementary School yr: 2000\n\nElementary school in Cobb County, Georgia\n\nMy kindergarten teacher Ms. Kuruth was a fool. Intentionally tried to misguide me almost got me killed and tried to crush my happiness.\n\nShe asked us all individually \"what we want to be when you grow up\". I said, \"If I grow up\", she interrupted me and said \"when!\" I said, \"No, IF! I grow up the Bible says we are not promised tomorrow.\" She condescendingly asks, \"And who told you that your Sunday school teacher?\" I replied, \"No I read it. My parents taught me to read all by myself.\" Eventually she asks, again \"What do you want to be when you grow up? \" I replied \"Happy\" Simple sweet answer right? Nope it's not good enough for her miserable self. She says, \"No you have to pick a job.\" (mind you some girl already said princess) I then ask why? She says,  \"You have to get a job when you're older.\" I respond, \"Then my job will be to be happy.\" She says, \" you have to pick a job and be a productive member to society\". I state, \"Won't I be more productive when happy the bad guys in super hero movies are always sad and mad.\" She completely ignored my statement and said, \"You have to pick a job\". I annoyingly say, \"Fine then firefighter!\" And just like that I caved to her pressure, dreams crushed at 5 years old of being happy (Not actually) by an ignorant teacher pushing adult problems onto children. Later she sent me to the bus after I told her my mom said, \"stay at ASP\". I'll never forget her face nor the man that sent me to buses that also ignored me pointing to the ASP button over my heart. I told him no as well and he still pushed me along to the busses. These ignorant people literally got me lost I i could've been kidnapped that day. I had to find the correct bus I had no idea where I was going kept asking each bus driver what neighborhood they're going to. Found my house rang the doorbell but only the dog came so i went and  waited in the backyard for 3 to 4 hours only to be greeted by my mom the dog and police. I stayed in the backyard to be out of sight. I went to the backyard because I knew that if I waited out front someone might see me and kidnap me. I knew as a child I am weak and easy to grab but oddly enough wasn't afraid of that truth.\n\nNeedless to say I'm a software engineer and enjoy my job but my goal in life is happiness not being an engineer as for now ima stay doin super villian shit.",
        "\u00a0My name is Tuminaro Yamasura. I'm thirty-three working as an accountant in Japan. \"Yamasura, you get those papers in yet?\" Keko asked stern. Keko was a by the books guy who worked hard.\n\n\"Um, yes I've got it all right here,\" I said.\n\n\"You two work way too hard around here,\" Tommy said poking over my cubicle. Tommy Jotiro was a guy with charm. He didn't always turn in reports on time, but he always talked his way out of it.\n\n\"It's called doing your job, and on time by the way,\" Keko said.\n\n\"Hey I do mine in my own time,\" Tommy said.\n\n\"Speaking of that, you got the Kenichi report, right?\" Keko asked.\n\n\"Yeah you'll have it after lunch,\" he said.\n\n\"Speaking of lunch, who's hungry?\" Komiko asked, popping up. Komiko was the energetic girl around the office. She was cute too.\n\n\"I think I'll just stay here. I got work to catch up on,\" I said, not moving my eyes from my computer.\n\n\"No way Yamasura boy, drinks are on me,\" Tommy said standing up.\n\n\"Jotiro, what have I said about drinking on lunch,\" Keko said rolling his eyes.\n\n\"It's fine I'm not going to drink too much, and don't call me that would yah,\" Tommy said.\n\n\"Come on Yamasura it will be fun,\" Komiko said smiling. I always said yes to something when Komiko smiled at me.\n\n\"Ok I'll go,\" I said, picking up my things.\n\n\"Looks like I'm tagging along to keep all of you out of trouble,\" Keko said.\n\n\"Yay, I'll grab my coat,\" Komiko said. As I stood up Tommy ran up next to me. \n\n\"Ok, dude you got to ask Komiko out soon.\"\n\n\"No, I think I'll just let her be.\"\n\n\"Naw dude F that, I see the smiles. She doesn't smile for me.\" I've never heard Tommy swear. I think it's a family thing.\n\n\"But you're a creep.\" I said with a plain face.\n\n\"I'll ignore that comment, just do me a favor and look happy.\" Even though he asked me it as a favor I could not comply. I just sat quietly as the others drank. I liked seeing everyone having fun even if I'm not having fun myself.\n\nSix months ago:\n\n\"Kire can I come in,\" I asked. I heard no response. I knocked on the door again, but no answer. It's always the same. I get home and knock on the door but she won't talk to me. Did I do something wrong? Could my actions have changed the circumstances.\n\nPresent day:\n\nI woke up ready to start another day. I got dressed looking bored as I brushed my teeth. I felt like someone was watching me. I turned before I spit but no one was there. I stopped at the 7/11 to grab a soup to heat up at work. I stood in front of the microwave at work as my cup spun around.\n\n\"Hey Yamasura,\" Tommy said, popping up out of nowhere.\n\n\"Hello Tommy good morning.\"\n\n\"Is that shrimp?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Can I have some?\"\n\n\"You didn't eat breakfast again, now why is it always me you ask for food.\"\n\n\"Because you're the nice one.\"\n\n\"Despite that I'll decline. I planned on eating all of it myself this time.\" I pulled the hot soup from the microwave and pulled the top off. As I smelled the hot soup, I noticed something strange. A floating orb right next to Komiko's head. I observed as I pulled noodles to my mouth. The orb turned around and there was a face on it. The face had a long tongue sticking out with these wide eyes staring at me. I just stared back at it. Komiko gave me a look of what are you staring at. I nervously tried to give her a look of I wasn't staring at you when the orb grabbed her chest making a crazy face. I jumped a bit and spilled all my soup on my lap. I freaked out as hot soup burned me. Komiko ran over and started wiping my lap with napkins as the orb was laughing insanely.\n\n\"Are you ok?\" Komiko asked worriedly.\n\n\"I'm fine thank you.\" She gave me this blushed nervous look. I looked down to see a bump in my pants.\n\n\"I'm sorry that shouldn't have happened,\" I said bowing in apologies. She just walked off fast. Oh god I'm such an idiot.\n\n\"Dude that was a nice move,\" Tommy said wheeling his chair over. I started cleaning my pants.\n\n\"That wasn't a move it was an accidental soup spill.\"\n\n\"Right, sure. Whatever you say man.\" I feel like I can't get anything right in this life I'm leading right now. I sat at my desk being busy.\n\n\"Hey man you busy?\" Keko asked.\n\n\"Just looking over signatures I got time.\"\n\n\"How are you feeling?\"\n\n\"Good you know. The workflow is good.\"\n\n\"No, not about work, in general how are you feeling?\" Every time someone asked me this question, I had to think about it, you know, how I felt in that moment.\n\n\"I'm surviving.\"\n\n\"I'm here if you got something on your mind.\"\n\n\"Thanks, I'll take you up on that if something crosses my mind.\" I feel like everyone just feels sorry for me. I got a raise after it happened and everyone treats me with what feels like forced kindness.\n\n\"Hey did you get the numbers for last week?\" Tommy asked. His voice boomed over the thin walls of his cubicle.\n\n\"Of course, I did,\" I said typing away.\n\n\"Can I see them?\"\n\n\"No, the point of it, them being reviewed twice is that we both make reports on them. Not you copying my answers like in fourth grade.\"\n\n\"You make me work harder. That's not a good thing,\" he said going back to his computer. I stood by the water cooler and looked at the water in my cup. This water is only refillable if I refill it. Nothing is without effort. I noticed the water moving in my cup. As I looked down into the cup the water splashed into my face as a blue hand came out of it. The office laughed as water ran down my face.\n\n\"Man, Yamasura, your luck is just, always down,\" Tommy said, slowing down his speech as Keko was prompting him to stop talking. I just walked to the bathroom and wiped my face off with a hand towel while looking in the mirror.\n\nNine months ago:\n\n\"What did you say dock?\" I asked the doctor. The doctor sighed.\n\n\"I'm sorry but she didn't make it.\"\n\nKire just sat there quietly. I've never heard silence from her. I've never seen the life drained out of her. The doctor tried to explain why this was happening to us. Kire wouldn't have it. I don't think I've heard her scream until now.\n\nPresent day:\n\nTommy did this funny walk over to me as I was grabbing my coat to leave work. \"Bro, gaming tonight?\"\n\n\"I'm not in the mood,\" I said.\n\n\"Dude you can't be like this forever.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" I knew what he meant, but I wanted to hear somebody say it.\n\n\"All mopey, dude you have to have at least a little fun.\" Walking home I stopped at the 7/11 to grab dinner. As I picked through random food, I saw the cute cashier glancing at me. As I looked behind me, I saw a man with pale gray skin. I felt disgusted to believe this, but the man that I believe only I can see was watching the cashier and spanking his monkey. I tried to pay for my food quickly. \n\n\"So, I see you around here quite a bit. You live around here?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, just up the street.\"\n\n\"Well I hope to see you in here again,\" she said as I walked out. As I walked by the window outside the pale man was humping a bag of dog food. Sometimes I wish my life was different. Why did I get the short straw of life? Everyone is proud of the work I do, but just cause I'm good at it does that mean that I want to do it forever.\n\nI stood in front of a vending machine outside my apartment. life is just a series of choices. It all starts with the simple stuff. Cherry, or grape. I think I've finally made an honest decision in my life. I'm going with grape. I pulled a coin from my pocket and inserted it into the machine. I pressed the big button labeled grape. The sound of nothing happened. Maybe choices don't matter. What if everything is decided for you? I kicked the machine and jumped around in anger. The sound of aluminum hit my ears. As I turned over the can I pulled from the machine the words diet hit me like a brick being thrown by a snot nosed kid. I headed up my stairs. As I entered my apartment, I tossed the soda in the trash. Diet might as well be poison. I filled a cup with gross tap water, and ate some spicy chips rolled in fancy bread. Will my life ever be something different, and if it won't be I think I'm ok with that. \n\nI got texts in the middle of the night showing videos of my co-workers partying. They think showing me their good times will make me see the fun I could be having. What is fun about going out to random clubs and partying every night. Getting so drunk you don't remember the night before. I like having my memory intact. What's wrong with a simple life. I used to play video games but they're just not fun for me anymore.\n\nThe next morning, I sat on my bed looking at the wall. My days off went kind of like this. I don't have much of a social life anymore. Kire had all the friends. None of them want to see me. I guess I wouldn't want to see them either. It would be strange, I guess. I have co-workers but I don't want to make personal relationships. Maybe I'll go to the zoo. I used to like that. Normally I just call work to see if they can use me. I pulled my laptop over to me. I was practicing coding. I thought making a video game would be fun. I had this idea of a skeleton as the main character of an RPG. That's a lot of work to be done with just one person though.\n\nI stood in front of a window of a manga store about mid-day. I walk just about everywhere in town. I haven't read one of these in a while, maybe I'll get back into it. I bought a book with a kid with reddish orange hair on the cover. I walked through the 7/11 to get lunch and dinner. That cute cashier was there again.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said cheerfully.\n\n\"Hello,\" I said back.\n\n\"What's in the bag?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing just doing some shopping.\" Before I could notice she was in my bag pulling out my manga book. That was rude anyone else would tell her off. I'm not anyone else.\n\n\"Oh, I've read this one. It's great, it's so long though.\"\n\n\"Please give me my book back.\"\n\n\"Here you go. I'm sorry I'm a curious person, my friends say it's a problem.\"\n\nFive months ago:\n\nI was in the hospital for a whole month. Kire was in there for 3 months. The time we spent apart was definitely a factor. The time spent apart made us realize who we both were. I was a person who didn't need much to survive and she needed everything. People say, in tragic moments is when they show their true colors, but I have never met anyone of these people. They could be right, or maybe I was always like this. Was Kire always like how she is now. I don't know how she is now. I hope she's living the life she wants.\n\nPresent day:\n\nI read the first couple pages of the book. Art style was nice. The story was kind of rushed though. The person in this book can see ghosts. He fights them to protect people. That sounds like a lot of work. What if an evil spirit attacked me? What would I do? I laid back in bed reading until I fell asleep. I woke up. I can't believe I took a nap in the middle of the day. What am I an infant? The sounds of the outside world came in through my window. My window faces a place I can't get out of my mind. Memories of stuff that don't bother me, but are still there. The sun reminded me of where the day was going.\n\nA year ago:\n\n\"Hey I see you're awake,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"What happened? Where is Kire?\" I asked.\n\n\"You won't be able to see her for a while, don't worry she's fine,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"Why am I here?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yamasura you and Kire were in a car crash.\"\n\nPresent day:\n\nThe next morning, I awoke to nothing. Silence filled my one room apartment as I got ready for work. The TV just sat there taking up space. I haven't turned that thing on in so long. At work it was casual day. I was wearing a suit. Tommy walked up wearing shorts and a Hawaiian shirt.\n\n\"Dude you didn't get the memo,\" he said.\n\n\"No, I got it. Things like this they're not for me.\"\n\n\"Well look, I saw this coming. I brought an extra shirt.\" The shirt he pulled out was all colorful, bright, and red. I'm not the type to participate in these things.\n\n\"You're in a suit, Yamasura, you're such a dork,\" Komiko said walking by and laughing. Komiko was wearing a shirt with a young boy with messy hair and an old balding man on it, with shorts. Why does it feel like I fail without trying?\n\n\"Hey you two, I need those reports today, so don't slack off,\" Keko said. Keko was wearing a simple attire, but still formal. He looked like an American teacher.\n\n\"You don't have faith?\" Tommy asked.\n\n\"Not in you, and you drag Yamasura down,\" Keko said. He was right if my cubicle wasn't by Tommy's I could be employee of the month or something. Everyone at work was laughing and having a good time. I wondered what would happen if I joined in. I stood up. Everyone looked at me. I pulled off my jacket and threw it at Tommy.\n\n\"Dude what the F,\" he said.\n\n\"Give me the shirt.\" He pulled out the shirt and threw it to me. I didn't feel any different pulling it on. Maybe if I walked over to the water cooler. I filled a cup with water and stood there. People just walked by. Maybe my efforts were for nothing.\n\n\"Hey Yamasura cute shirt,\" Komiko said walking by. I just nodded.\n\n\"Hey I'm wearing the same thing, hell I gave him the shirt!\" Tommy yelled watching me. I don't feel the power of casual day, but blending in helps me not feel out of place. I should get one of these shirts. Back at my desk I sat doing work.\n\n\"Ok you guys got the reports, right?\" Keko asked.\n\n\"Yep yep right here,\" Tommy said waving his forms.\n\n\"Here you go,\" I said handing in mine.\n\n\"Good job Jotiro, you managed to turn one in on time,\" Keko said smiling.\n\n\"Hey you're not my father get it, stop calling me that or HR is going to hear from me,\" Tommy said. I gave Tommy back his shirt and walked home after work. I stopped at the 7/11 just like every night. I stopped right before the door as sounds caused me to listen.\n\n\"Just give me all the shit bitch I ain't playing,\" said a man holding the cashier at gunpoint. She loaded the bag quickly and he made a break for it. As he ran out the door it seems I had one foot out too far and the robber tripped on it. \"Are you fucking crazy you want to get shot you son off a bitch,\" he said pointing the gun at me from the ground. It was at that point I realized a very important thing about myself.\n\nFour months ago:\n\nKire wouldn't leave the room. Even if I asked really nicely. Nothing. I don't know what to do. As I stepped into the kitchen, I noticed a paper on the ground. It was a list of names. The name Yoriko was circled. The day she left the room was the day I never saw her again.\n\nThree months ago:\n\n\"Do you know why you're here?\" the doctor asked.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"What is the last thing you remember?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Don't be alarmed when I tell you this,\" the doctor said. He took a pause. \"Yamasura, you tried to kill yourself.\" he took another pause. \"If your landlord wasn't around collecting rent, well I don't think you'd be alive.\"\n\nPresent day:\n\nIt was at that point I realized a very important thing about myself. I'm not afraid anymore. I pulled his hand towards me. The look in this man's face was pure fear. What was he scared of? Taking a life maybe. Going to jail, or just simply failure. He dropped the gun and ran down the street. As he turned a corner he got tackled by cops.",
        "I remember when I was 8-9 in primary school, there was a friend of mine who loved to pull down peoples pants (Boys pants ofc) at school. It was something that a lot of kids at the time did. One day, he decided to pull my sports pants down revealing my undies. And of course, the girl was there to witness it. I ended up crying in front of her, but to my surprise, she felt sorry for me and bought me a paddle pop.",
        "In the beginning he was a different man\n\nI sometimes wonder if I don't really speak much about the beginning of my abusive marriage. If you've been in an abusive relationship you know all too well that it doesn't start that way. Come on do you really think if someone starts off being a dick to you, you would stay? Of course not, you have nothing invested, so you would run. \n\nAbusers know this as well, so they start off on their best behaviors just as mine did. He will make you think you're the only woman in the world. He wined and dined me, he treated me like gold, bought me thoughtful gifts, flowers and jewelry. He loved bombed me until I fell and I fell hard. Yes, in the beginning he swept me off my feet, I felt like I was the luckiest woman in the world. I was so in love that I sold my business, rented out my home and gave my dog to my mother and moved 1500 miles away to be with this amazing man.\n\nDid we have good times? Of course we did, incredible times, I felt like I won the man lottery. He was all I dreamed about, the perfect husband and father material and he had dreams and goals, and was a hard worker bonus!\nI could picture a life, building and working towards our dreams together. We enjoyed the same things, fishing, the outdoors, shooting pool, it was as God made him perfect for me.\n\nAgain in case you don't know, abusers don't show you their dark side until they know they have your reeled in...hook, line and sinker. They have to make sure you're in deep, that you are truly in love first before they start their manipulation.\n\nAnd this love story was no different. About a month after I moved away from all of my family and friends, it started with a big red flag. A \"we have to talk\" moment after a long day at work.\nHe informed me that the only two friends I had down here, he didn't like. And I needed to choose them or him and yes, he was dead serious. \n\nMy one friend was my friend since we were 6 years old, but because she slept around in and after high school he didn't want me hanging out with whores. \nWho didn't sleep around in the 80s? Seriously? But yes he was. My second friend I've known since we were 12. He's been my best friend since then but because he's gay and he didn't like \"those type of people\" he had to go too.\nYes, the only 2 people I knew here had to go to please him and guess what I did. I cut them off, stopped taking their phone calls and everything because I was so in love. \n\nYes, this was a huge red flag and so many of us get them but we poo-poo them away. I was thinking how could I go home with my tail between my legs? I sold my business, rented out my home so I go back like oops I made a mistake, he wasn't prince charming after all and what? Live in my mother's basement? No, I had a big ego. I said he loves me. That's why he's doing it (repeating what he said to me) if I loved him I would want to make him happy, wouldn't I? \n\nWe all have the excuses we tell ourselves to justify the red flags but they are still there and will get worse, trust me when I tell you that. I am telling you this because so many people ask how do you get with a abusiver? They say didn't you see it? No, because in the beginning they were all you dreamt about, that perfect man you fell madly in love with. You were blindsided first with love then with the abuse.\n\nSo today my friends, I'm begging you to look out for the red flags, they are always there. Little things they say or do. Keep your eyes open for things that aren't right, that you can't put your finger on, that don't sit right with you, these are all signs. And even if you fall in love when that dark side comes out, get outta there because it won't get any better but it will get a whole lotta worse.\nThere is so much help out there today, women's groups, shelters, Facebook groups, and of course I am always here to lend a helping hand. But please, please see the signs before it's too late because I understand all too well that in the beginning he's a different man.\n\n\"Be the change you want to see\"\n@Treadmilltreats",
        "Who knew that my cat, walking on a windowsill, could have started this never ending nightmare I am now unable to escape. \nWhat started as a harmless mishap, my baseball cup full of googly eyes, kept since childhood from my old stuffed animals, spilled onto the floor as my cat walked his usual route through my room. \nI picked up the 100+ googly eyes and put them back in the cup. \nProblem solved, or so I thought.\nNow I was late for work. \nI needed to quick brush my teeth and take a shower. \nI squeezed my toothpaste onto my toothbrush, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing, it had a googly eye in it! \nI must be seeing things. \nI dismissed it and hopped in the shower. \nWhen I lathered up the shampoo into my hair, I felt something on my head. I grabbed ahold of the small object and pulled it out, another googly eye! \nSurely this is just left over from picking up all the googly eyes off of the floor. \nI went to get dressed, there were two googly eyes in each one of my socks! When I shook them out onto the floor, I quickly put them back into the cup thinking that they also must\u2019ve just been left over from the spill. \nBut when I slid onto my jeans and there were several googly eyes in each pocket, I really started to panic; what is going on here? \nMaybe I was still half asleep, a cup of coffee would help. \nI opened up the bag of coffee beans to put in the coffee grinder but the entire bag of coffee beans was googly eyes. \nI freaked. Was someone playing a practical joke on me? Maybe I was hallucinating from lack of food; I went for a bowl of cereal.\n I took the lid off the milk and on the inside of the cap was the largest of all googly eyes, staring right at me! \nAnd the cereal, the bag of Cheerios itself, was none other than googly eyes. I had had it! \nI needed to get something in my stomach. I was starting to feel nauseous. I grabbed an apple and took a quick bite, a googly eye stared straight back at me from the core!\nThere had to be something going on in my house, I knew I had to get out, get myself a cuppa coffee and something to eat. Get my bearings.\nI went out to my car and first made sure I had some money in the ashtray where I normally kept my change. Nooooooo!!! \nIt was full of googly eyes! \nI thought, I just need to get out of this house, get a new perspective.\nI jumped in my car and thrust the key into the ignition. The car wouldn\u2019t turn over. What? Now? A dead battery? \nI jumped out of the car and popped the hood. \nWhere the entire engine should\u2019ve been\u2026 Googly eyes. \nNothing but googly eyes!!! As the terror swept over to me, I saw my last hope, the garage door opener on the wall. I lunged for it, sliding all over the floor on all the googly eyes.\nAs I pushed the garage door opener and the door slowly began to open, the avalanche of googly eyes began to pour into the garage from what used to be the world - flooding into my garage like a tidal wave. The googly eyes have taken over everything, rising and filling every hole and space that I knew to be my life. \nI am sinking. \nThe googly eyes have now consumed me, I feel my body breaking apart into tiny, round pieces, with a large white background and a small black center - that rolls around. \ud83d\udc40",
        "\u00a0As Summer fades Winter makes its way. The leaves began to show the way to the new season. The naked trees look embarrassed and the snow comes to blanket the grown. But we are in the middle. The snow hasn\u2019t come yet. Autumn is a short time. A time spent slowly changing. The Sun is starting to ignore this time of year. The lights became bright. Whispers filled the room as flash came from every angle. Blonde hair, blue eyes and a clean look with his hair slicked back.\n\n\n\u201cWhat does school mean to you?\u201d the voice asked from behind the camera.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLearning all I need to know,\u201d he said, smiling as cameras flashed around. Brown hair and green eyes took the chair next. Her outfit was well picked out to go with the flash of the camera.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat does school mean to you?\u201d There was no pause; she was ready.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPushing me and my friends forward into life.\u201d Black hair with glasses hiding hazel eyes almost tripped taking the seat next. One after another the children took the seat being given the same question over and over. Short hair, long hair, skirts, shorts. All the different colors of clothing and all the different sizes of kids filled the lens of a camera. Long black hair with the bangs cut above the eyes. A simple blue shirt over a white skirt. The stool was moved to make way for her wheels. Her chair was stopped and locked into place. Her head hung low with a face that could break a camera\u2019s lens. The whispers stopped. There seemed to be hesitation.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat does school mean to you?\u201d She lifted her head showing everyone her sad dead face. As the words dropped from her mouth screams filled her head. School wasn\u2019t nice to Autum. Autum was later taken out of school from all the bullying of her condition. Autum has Body Integrity Identity Disorder. Autum hates her legs so much that she\u2019d rather they not be there. She sits in a wheelchair everyday in the same spot in her living room doing nothing. The light shines in through the trees and through the window every morning. Autum lived in a fairly nice house on a street in the middle of nowhere. This street was so big that all the houses were far apart and behind each house was basically a forest. Every morning Autum is woken up by her housekeeper Beth and helped into her chair. Beth is an older woman who spends her time taking care of Autum and the house. Beth\u2019s blonde hair is normally coming down the side in a braid.\u00a0 The blinds were pulled back as the sun peered into the room. Beth pulled back the blanket as Autum hissed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI do say you are quite creature-ish today,\u201d Beth said, rolling up the blanket to fold it. Beth\u2019s job is to maintain the house and take care of Autum. Her job was not always like this. Ever Since the death of Autum\u2019s mothers Beth has done more than what is needed around the house.\u00a0\n\nAutum rolled over facing Beth with her arms sticking out. Beth sighed as she pulled Autum from bed and sat her down in the wheelchair next to the bed. Beth pushed her all the way to the living room and stopped her in front of the big glass window. This was normal for Autum. This was all the sun she got. Waiting for her food her eyes always drooped to her lap. After breakfast was when she was home schooled by Beth. Sitting in her chair waiting for her food was normal, but what was not normal was the sound she heard next. A loud roar broke through the walls. Autum looked up as branches dropped from the sky. She stood a bit in her chair only to drop back down as Beth walked back with a plate of pancakes. \u201cNow don\u2019t be fussing today. I don\u2019t want you to be mean to the new help.\u201d Autum looked through the leaves and branches to see a man holding bolt cutters as he chopped at the tree. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t do everything around here.\u201d Beth turned back to the kitchen to finish dishes. Autum pulled her head back to see Beth washing away. Jerking her head back forward, another branch fell. Autum tried to scoop forward for a better view. Her chair seemed to be stuck in place. Autum leaned down to undo the latch holding her chair in place. Having trouble grabbing the latch Autum jumped right back up as the back door opened. Standing in the doorway was a tall blonde man. His face looked like he fell over in the dirt. His chin was small with big blue eyes under hair that was pushed to the side. He was normally built. He had on a dirty white shirt under overalls.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you for a glass of water.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at Autum. He looked like he was trying his best to avoid eye contact.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry dear.\u201d Beth made her way over with a glass of water. Autum lowered her head as their eyes met. \u201cAutum say hello to your new gardener,\u201d Beth said putting her hands on Autum\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThis is Sunny.\u201d Sunny took two big steps over rubbing the back of his head.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHi Autum, I\u2019m the gardener Sunny. Right you already said my name,\u201d Sunny nervously said. Sunny just awkwardly stood there in the silence. Beth slapped Autum on the back.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d Autum said quietly. She kept her head down, not looking at him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cRight, I better get back to it. It was nice to meet you,\u201d he said, walking backwards outside. The door closed as the sound of an engine roar started up again. This was the first day Autum met Sunny. Sunny was a bit older than Autum. He got a job as a gardener to help pay for college. Everyday Sunny would come by the house to clean up and water the yard and everyday Autum would watch him from the living room window. If Sunny saw her watching he would smile and wave and Autum would look away as if she was never looking in the first place. If there was any conversation it was short and brief. Sunny would ask her stuff like how\u2019s your day going and Autum would say stuff like It\u2019s fine or ok. Autum didn\u2019t spend any time with anyone except Beth and the small moments with Sunny. Autum\u2019s father was always away on work. It would seem that he dived into his work after his wife\u2019s death. It wasn\u2019t always like this however. Autum used to have friends and a life at school, but kids did not understand what was wrong with her. I\u2019m not even sure Autum knew what was wrong with her. It didn't take long for rumors to spread. Soon after Autum became a school outcast because who would want to hang out with the girl who pretended to not feel her legs. When Autum is in stress she can be seen scratching rapidly at her legs. Beth started to put gauze all over Autum\u2019s legs to help prevent this.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNow you wouldn\u2019t be staring at Sunny working his butt off now would you?\u201d Beth asked, coming up behind Autum as she gazed out the window. Autum jerked herself, turning her chair to the left. \u201cOh dear it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed about. I mean look at him, he is quite handsome for his age. I mean an old woman like me would kill to have a man like that,\u201d Beth said, hugging the air as she was lost in thought. As Autum shifted away from the window she then was facing the TV. Autum had not watched anything in a long time. She kept herself disconnected from the outside world. \u201cHere did you want to watch something,\u201d Beth said, turning on the TV. Autum freaked a bit as Beth dropped the remote. Like slow motion it went right in between the couch cushions. Beth walked away before Autum could get a word out. A cartoon of a cat and a mouse played on the screen. Autum reached out past her chair for the remote that stuck out wedged in the couch. As her fingers got closer the sound of a chuckle pulled her back.\n\n\n\u201cThis one is a classic,\u201d Sunny said with a light laugh. Autum pulled back, almost rolling into a ball in her chair. Sunny\u2019s eyes darted to her. \u201cWere you trying to get the remote?\u201d he asked, walking over. She shrieked under her breath and wrapped herself in her arms. She tried to change her mind but her mind was caught on something. It was the cartoon sound effects that were award-winning. It wasn't the cake being made by Beth in the kitchen. It was the smell of a man. A smell Autum had not smelled in a long time. Her hands lowered as his voice came back. \"Here you go, I didn't mean to bother you,\" Sunny said just holding the remote out to her. It floated in the air and in his hand. She swiped it from him and turned off the TV. A quiet murmur could be heard as she crossed her arms and looked away. Sunny said no more words and went back outside to water the garden. The day was as simple as always. Autum fell asleep in her chair and was only woken up to the sound of the back door.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just leave, it is just about dinner time.\u201d Autum dropped her head back to see Beth talking to Sunny in the doorway. It was hard to focus on them as they were flipped and upside down. She turned around in her chair watching.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI really appreciate it, but I don\u2019t want to bother Autum.\u201d Sunny looked over worried, noticing she was watching. Autum hid behind her bangs.\n\n\n\u201cNonsense we would love to have you Beth said pulling Autum close. Sunny\u2019s face went from worried to a faint smile and Autum\u2019s face went from still to worried.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOnly if it\u2019s ok with Autum,\u201d Sunny said, dropping his head in thankfulness. Autum\u2019s eyes went wide as her chair was pulled into the kitchen.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNow you listen here missy that boy works his butt off to take care of this house, and it would be rude not to have him for dinner,\u201d Beth said quietly in Autum\u2019s face. Autum just nodded yes frantically. \u201cGood.\u201d She pushed Autum back in front of Sunny. He just gave a big smile. Beth slapped the chair as Autum looked for the words.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok with me,\u201d Autum said hanging her head letting her bangs drape. They all sat around the dinner table eating mashed potatoes and chicken. Autum sat there staring at her food. Her hands rested on her chair\u2019s armrests.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDoes she need help eating?\u201d Sunny asked Beth quietly in her ear. Autum looked over angry. \u201cOh I didn\u2019t mean to say it like that, I should have just asked you directly,\u201d he said frantically.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry dear, I think she is just shy. You know her legs are in working order as well,\u201d Beth said pointing her spoon at Autum. The anger in Autum\u2019s face spread to her whole body as she kicked Beth. \u201cSee just like I said,\u201d Beth said getting up. Beth cleaned off her plate and turned to face everyone. \u201cWell it would seem I am done eating. You two have nice conversation.\u201d Autum gave a horrible scowl. Beth gave one back. As Beth turned to walk away Autum flicked mashed potatoes at her hitting the wall next to her. Beth looked back in anger then just kept walking. Sunny was a little shocked watching it all.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI understand if you don\u2019t want to eat with me. I\u2019m a stranger,\u201d Sunny said looking down at his food. \u201cBut I find myself curious, and you don\u2019t have to say anything. So you sit in a chair like your body won\u2019t move, but it will.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMy legs don\u2019t work,\u201d Autum said quietly. She started eating fast to drown out his talking.\n\n\n\u201cRight, I\u2019m sorry for bringing it up. You know when I was in highschool I tore my leg playing sports. It wasn\u2019t that bad, but I thought I wasn\u2019t gonna be able to walk ever again,\u201d Sunny said slowly getting back to eating. the air became awkward. Neither of them knew what to say. The tension was cut as Beth plopped down a cake. The sides were chocolate with red icing dripping down. And the top was pink with strawberries. Autum leaned forward as Sunny cut her off with his hand. \"Here don't get up, I can cut one for you.\" Autum sunk down fast in her chair. Sometimes she doesn't even notice she is using her legs. Sunny cut her an end slice of cake and slid it over to her. Autum just stared at it. \"It's not gonna bite,\" Sunny said, laughing a bit.. Autum looked up to see cake dripping off his lips and chin. A held back chuckle began to emerge. Autum's eyes began to diverge as the sound of another chuckle hit her ears. Beth was watching from the couch and looking right at Autum giggling. Autum became red and covered her mouth. Beth smirked and turned around to face the TV. \u201cWhat is it? Is there something on my face?\u2019 Sunny asked as he pulled up a napkin and cleaned his face. Autum tried to turn her attention to her plate and brought up a big spoon full to her mouth. \u201cDid I get it?\u2019 Sunny asked, pulling down the napkin. Autum fumbled with her spoon as the sight of a missed spot brought out more laughter from inside her. She caught the spoon tight in her hand but a small amount fell onto her lap. Autum just looked up as her face grew ever so red. \u201cHere let me help you,\u201d Sunny said standing up. Sunny just stood there with a napkin looking down at Autum as she lowered her red face.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHere allow me,\u201d Beth said, cutting in between them cleaning Autum\u2019s lap.\n\n\n\u201cRight, then I\u2019ll just clean up here,\u201d Sunny said as he started picking up plates.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNow why are you doing that? That\u2019s my job not yours,\u201d Beth said, taking the plates from his hands.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, hanging his head low. Autum peered around Beth to see Sunny with a calm but confused expression. \u201cI really do appreciate having me for dinner, but I really must be going,\u201d Sunny said, getting himself in order. He checked for all his belongings and made his way to the door.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe would be glad to have you stay again,\u201d Beth said, turning to him. He just nodded to her with a smile. His eyes shifted to Autum as his face followed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThank you I had fun Autum,\u201d he said with a big smile. Autum pulled herself from the table and rolled over to him a bit.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d Autum said quietly. Beth turned around in surprise. Sunny waved before walking out the door.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSomeone had fun with the gardener, ah?\u201d Beth said, hugging Autum from behind. It only took a second for Autum to sink her teeth into Beth\u2019s arm. \u201cDemon child you are,\u201d Beth said, pulling away as she followed her words with more in a different language as she shouted walking away. It didn't take long for Beth to come back and wheel Autum to bed. Beth pulled all of Aurum's clothes off and slipped her into white pajamas with cats on them. Autum normally stayed awake for an hour before falling asleep. She thought about all sorts of stuff. Maybe what it would be like to work in an office, or be a superhero, or be popular at school. The tears could not be held back. The thought of her mother krept in. Her breathing became heavy. Every thought became nuclear. As she reached for her beeper on the side table her hand froze. She thought about Beth and how much Beth hated her. She imagined Beth telling her she should have never called me up here. No one cared about her. It felt like hands we're grabbing her arms from behind. She shook and slammed her arms down on the bed. Screaming spilled out of her head. The light came on as Beth ran into the room in her robe. \"It's ok Beth is here,\" Beth said, holding Autum. Autum tried to relax her breathing. \"You know I bought new shoes with these gel things. It's like you're walking on water,\" Beth said, trying to occupy Autumn's mind. Autum filled her head with the thoughts of new shoes. She imagiened Beth walking out of a store with new shoes on. Autum gripped Beth tight. Autum\u2019s breathing slowed down as Beth pulled back a bit. Beth smiled at Autum as she stroked her hair. Autum knew that Beth didn\u2019t hate her, but when the night terors attack all logic is thrown out the window for Autum. The night terrors began shortly after her mother\u2019s passing. There are triggers for her attacks but even Autum can\u2019t explain them. Most of her attacks happen at night and normaly wake her up from sleep. Another morning always goes the same. Beth wakes up Autum and pulls her into her chair. Beth starts a bath that Autum takes every other day. While Autum is in the bath Beth normaly starts breakfast. Autum can wash herself but Beth always has a ear listening. Autum needs to be pulled from the tub and dressed. Autum and Beth sit around the table every morning eating breakfast.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI thought you liked your eggs runny?\u201d Beth asked, pointing her fork at Autum\u2019s plate.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I like it like that anymore,\u201d Autum said picking at her bacon. Beth just shrugged and focused on her food. A knock hit the back door as it opened.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey I\u2019ll be in the backyard,\u201d Sunny said waving to them from the back door. Beth nodded and started picking up the mess of food Autum didn\u2019t finish. Autum backed up from the table and rolled over to the back window. Beth just smiled looking at Autum watching sunny water plants.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDo you want to go outside?\u201d Beth asked, grabbing Autum\u2019s chair. Autum shook her head no but Beth pushed her outside. Autum\u2019s chair was on the cement a couple inches from the grass. Her toes almost touched the grass. Her head became loud with thought. Before screams could spill out Autum was caught off guard.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t come out here much do you?\u201d Sunny asked, pulling himself off his knees. Autum just shook her head no. Sunny looked like he wanted to ask something then looked back at the plants. \u201cYou know these Vines need something to hold on to cause they grow up.\u201d Autum looked at him confused. Sunny always just started talking to fill the silence. \u201cYou really do have a beautiful garden. Would you like me to tell you more about what\u2019s in it?\u201d Autum didn\u2019t like the garden. Her mom spent most of her time here. Sunny reached out his hand. Autum did a bit of a wheelie. \u201cOh how insensitive of me. You know I was never really good around people. Especially girls,\u201d Sunny said, rubbing the back of his head. Autum looked away blushing. Sunny kneeled down sniffing a flower. \u201cYou know Daffodil means rebirth. These are always my favorites.\u201d Autum had a flash that took over. A woman was in place of Sunny.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou know they mean rebirth. I just love these ones,\u201d she said, smiling at Autum. Tears began to take the form of running water on Autum\u2019s face. She was snapped back as Sunny grabbed her shoulder.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAutum are you ok?\u201d He asked, looking into her eyes through her bangs. Her face became bright red as she shook him off, wiping her tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I just wanted to make sure you were ok.\u201d He pulled back as tears fell onto his arm. The silence was cut short by Sunny. \u201cYou must have an allergy, let's get you inside,\u201d he said, turning her around and pushing her inside. There was silence for a couple seconds as he locked her chair down in the same spot she was always at. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for bothering you so much, I just want to get to know you more I guess,\u201d he said standing up and looking away from her. She reached for his hand as it flashed as someone else\u2019s. She imagined her mom walking ahead of her as she ran up to grab her hand. She pulled back and sat still.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Autum said with a faint smile as she looked down at her lap. As she slowly looked up Sunny was gone. Her heart skipped a beat to only speed up as she turned to see him smiling at her from outside as he watered the plants. She sprung up out of her chair nervously trying to pull down the blinds. She fell out of her chair. She was about to call out until she thought about what would happen if she was too loud. Sunny might run to her side and help her up. Bad thoughts swirled around in her head. It felt like steam was releasing from her head. She called out Beth\u2019s name but to no eval as the sound of her doing dishes was too loud. Autum crawled to the couch and grabbed the TV remote. Autum pulled herself in an upright position and sat steady. She threw her arm back and launched the remote at some pots and pans hanging above the sink.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell!\u201d Beth yelled, flipping around. Beth looked around for the cause to see Autum sitting on the floor, legs straight. \u201cWhat is the matter with you? You know you can call to me,\u201d Beth said, walking over in rage. Beth stood there for a moment. She noticed the blinds half up and half down. As she fixed them she saw Sunny cutting the grass. \u201cOh you were shy and didn\u2019t want the gardener to come lift you up in his arms.\u201d Autum shook her head fearlessly. \u201cI can fix this.\u201d Beth smiled as she stepped to the side and opened the window. \u201cOh Sunny, can you come here for a second!\u201d Beth shouted with a bit of giggle in her voice. Autum beat red, grabbed Beth\u2019s leg and shook it back and forth. The sound of the mower stopping turned Autum\u2019s head into nothing but emotions. Autum tried to climb up Beth. Beth pulled the window closed as she turned to Autum hanging off her arm. Beth raised her arm as Autum dropped onto her feet. Her legs buckled as she fell backwards into her chair. Beth covered her mouth to hold back a laugh.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDid you need something?\u201d Sunny asked, walking in.\u00a0\n\n\n\"No, all taken care of thank you dear,\" Beth said with a grin. Sunny just nodded and went back to work. Sunny gave Beth a death stare filled with rage. \"I swear you're a demon with that look,\" Beth said, going back to dishes. Autum just relaxed in her chair. It didn't take long for her to fall asleep. The walls around her moved as a door opened. As Sunny walked through the door it felt like he was miles away only for him to be right in front of her. He gave a great big smile.\n\n\n\"Hey Autum,\" he said, putting his hand on her cheek. She just sat there opened mouth as his hand lowered to her lips. His lips soon followed. The words hey Autum echoed in her head until she woke up. Sunny was waving his hand in front of her. \"Hey Autum, I couldn't find Beth. I just want to say I'm done for the day.\" Autum didn't notice her blushed cheeks. She just nodded to him. His hand floated to her cheek. Before he touched her cheek his hand tensed up. Autum was stuck in awe. \"Are you feeling ok?\" he asked, feeling her head. She said nothing and just looked into his eyes. His eyes lowered and met her's.\u00a0\n\n\n\"I'm ok,\" she said at a normal volume. Sunny seemed kinda taken back at how she spoke.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Then I shall take my leave. Goodbye Autum, see you tomorrow,\" he said, pulling his bag over his shoulder.\u00a0\n\n\n\"See you tomorrow,\" Autum said looking down at her lap with a faint smile. There was a bright smile always hiding under all that sadness. Beth had trouble getting Autum to smile or laugh. Not even Aurum's father could get a rise out of her. Autum did not look forward to seeing her father when he eventually did come around. It was as if they stayed away from each other because they were both reminders of the pain they shared. Autum and her father sat on a dock watching the seagulls swarm the beach.\n\n\n\"Here let me,\" her father said, pulling her out of the chair. He sat her down so her feet could dangle in the water. They just sat there in silence. Autum thought about what Sunny would say in this moment.\n\n\n\"Hey look at all the seagulls, you know I caught one with my bare hands once,\" Sunny said in her mind. She saw his smile and without knowing imitated it.\n\n\n\"It's been so long since I've seen you smile,\" her father said softly. Tears began to run down his face. She opened her arms and embraced his sadness. The tears that ran down her back off of her father's face helped fill the lake. They got back home with time for Autum to be schooled by Beth. Autum was kissed on the cheek by her father and left by the kitchen table. As her father walked out Sunny walked in saying hello to her father.\n\n\n\"Good morning Autum,\" Sunny said walking by.\n\n\n\"Morning,\" Autum said with a smile. Sunny turned and smiled back at her as he walked out the back door.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Now open your book dear,\" Beth said sitting at the table. The lessons went more or less the same as they always did, only this time Autum had her attention elsewhere. Beth slapped Aurum's book as she stared out the window. \"I see the gardener has your attention as always.\" Autum looked back at Beth with a slight luminous look. Beth looked back at her with curiosity. Autum had her fingers on the table tapping them fast. Before anyone could say anything Sunny walked in.\n\n\n\"Don't mind me just using the bathroom,\" Sunny said walking by the kitchen table. Aurum's eyes followed him around the house until they landed on Beth who was almost gasping.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Maybe he does, can we just focus on the work,\" Autum said. Beth looked astonished. Beth said nothing more on the matter and went back to the lesson. When Sunny made it back out Autum nervously waved a bit.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Hope the lessons are going well ladies,\" he said smiling at them as he made his way back outside. Autum just rested her head in her hands listening to Beth. Words floated around in Aurum's head. The lessons were in chunks all dancing around what was really on her mind. Her finger danced around in a circle on the table as she watched Sunny cut the grass outside the window.\u00a0",
        "Hello Everybody, I am currently rewriting and publishing Book 1 of my series, the Arbolarbres Chronicles, you can check it here[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46350/arbolarbres-chronicles--conflict-in-skyhigh-fast-paced](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46350/arbolarbres-chronicles--conflict-in-skyhigh-fast-paced)\n\nHere is the synopsis\n\n( Book 1 Completed)\u00a0 A young arbolarbre (Treeman) called Oak Quercus must stop his carnivorous mad King (Xidor Cedre) from sending his nation into a war to feed his gluttony for flesh and his\u00a0 sudden quest for immortality.\n\nHowever, he will have to face opposition from his vegetarian countrymen with diverging opinions on how to stop the King's madness.\u00a0\n\nDiscover it in the first book of the Arbolarbres chronicles (One chapter every week day)\n\nNew rewritten version coming soon in the following months.\n\nWhat to expect: Mc growing over time, great tragedy ending with plot twists along the way. Philosophical stakes, internal stakes and external stakes. It's a progression fantasy.\n\nHere is chapter 5, context: Oak gets detained by King Xidor and his henchmen Karel due to not paying his taxes, while his parents are taken to another prison. He wakes up there and acquire news power as well as a new mission.\n\nChapter 5\n\nApril 1290\n\nThe Evil King\n\nOak was taken to a watchtower made of black stone. The tower stood above the royal castle located in a forest at the edge of Xidorville. His Majesty used this tower as a dungeon, and the captives were held on the top floor. Thus, they could not escape without having to face the regiments posted in the various floors of the tower or risk jumping into the void to escape their incarceration.\n\nFrom there originated, the king's order to leave the windows wide to motivate them to choose the path of the skies; the torment was constant.\n\nOak awoke in a dark cell with oxidized copper bars where a stench emanated from a decaying corpse. A strong, cold wind came from the open windows. It blew the rotten leaves of the dead man's hair. \\*Buush, Buush\\*. These flew through the windows or crossed the bars to come and clash with the massive iron door that made up the only entrance to the room.\n\nHe searched the dead man's robe, a sort of indigo wizard's robe, and came across a volume filled with hieroglyphics and written in a strange language. Moreover, there was a hairy eye on the book cover. The Arbolarbre opened the book, when suddenly, the iris opened, flooded with tears and began to look at him intensely.\n\n*He\u2019s so sad, just like me... Where are ya, R\u00e9gis, Cyntia, Jasmine? Are ya dead like this Arbolarbre? If you\u2019re alive, do you still love me? Do you hold me responsible? Gotta*  *know... Gotta*  *get out of here.*\n\nOak began to read. The mysterious hieroglyphics became words that were audible, legible, and understandable. The image of a middle-aged, 75-year-old arbolarbre [\\[1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/submit#_ftn1)appeared before his eyes as a hologram. He wore a long indigo wizard's robe with a hat of the same color. His silver leafy hair protruded from the hat and contrasted with his golden eyes. The Image began to speak.\n\n\"This is my diary, my name is Ignis Succensio and I was executed by King Xidor C\u00e8dre a year ago in the spring of 1289. Before I died, I wrote and encrypted my story on its pages. I was born in the kingdom of the Arbolarbres like any other Arbolarbre, but in a noble family and due to my social rank, I ended up in the king's court.\n\nThat's where things got complicated. My role was to study magic and discover all the secrets of the arcane and reveal them to the king. The pretext he used to justify these studies was that magic would improve the gardening practices of the kingdom.\n\nThe image of King Xidor appeared, a brown-barked spruce man with violet eyes and green leafy hair. He began to speak to the wizard. \"Ignis, you are the best sorcerer I know and an honor to the god that begat us, continue in your search for the best plant growth techniques.\n\nThe image of Xidor disappeared and was replaced by the image of Ignis in his laboratory, crushing some herbs with a mortar. His laboratory was a bright room with black stone walls and floors. There, hundreds of powders, and herbs were strewn across a red ceramic table. Ignis said, \"Thus,  I continued my studies as a faithful servant, not knowing that Xidor was diverting knowledge for his own use. I discovered that he was raising animals such as pigs, lambs and cows for his own consumption; eating meat is a grave sin and he knew it.\n\n*Xidor is carnivore? This bastard steals our taxes to finance this? I understand the priest better now... Xidor must have gotten rid of him for revenge... Calm down, Oak. It's none of your business... Gotta go out and save your parents.*\n\nHe continued to read Ignis Succensio's story. The laboratory had disappeared and was replaced by a large room with golden walls and candlesticks hanging on the wall. Dozens of solid gold tables occupied the room. Xidor was sitting alone at one of them, eating a lamb shank, an expression of pure pleasure on his face. \"Indeed, the monarch pretended to be a paragon of virtue and the defender of laws and faith while he indulged in debauchery.\"\n\nIgnis entered the room and approached the king. \u201cThus, I confronted him when I caught him in the banquet hall, chewing meat. I gave him a pained look; it hurt to see him like that. \"What are you doing, my king, you are lowering yourself, abandoning yourself to vice.\u201d\u201d\n\nXidor sat back and gave him a frank look. \"I\u2019ve not been able to stop since the moment my lips tasted a wild bird\u2019s flesh. I will obtain immortality like the reborn warrior.\"\n\nThe sorcerer Ignis Succensio removed his sorcerer's hat, revealing his silver hair. He sat down next to Xidor. \"The reborn warrior? What is that?\"\n\nXidor gave him a toothy grin, with the eyes of a feral beast. \"A legend, a warrior is reborn on the battlefield after eating a wild bird\u2019s meat.\u201d\n\nIgnis shuddered at what he saw in the king's eyes. He passed his hand in front of his face, as if to wake him up from a nightmare. Ignis believed that the king was not in his normal state.\n\n\"Immortality? But what nonsense, no one can become immortal. Get a grip, my king.\"\n\nKing Xidor then stood up suddenly, swinging his wooden chair on the white marble floor. \u201cPull myself together? there is a war going on in my head, I keep trying to resist temptation, but it overcomes my will.\"\n\nThe king froze on the spot, caught in a cold sweat. \\*Brr\\* I am disgusted with myself but I cannot die. Kill me before I kill you! I cannot let you reveal my secret to the people, it would become a public scandal.\"\n\nIgnis stood up in turn, put his hands in front of him. \"Calm down, the people have a right to know your secrets, to know their true king. Let me help you. It is only an addiction, it will change.\"\n\n\"No it won't!\", \"he exploded in rage before grabbing his scythe and leaping at me.\" I dodged him and kicked him, running out of the castle before I could beg for help from the guard. I did not want to hurt my king and that was my mistake.\" The image of the banquet hall disappeared and gave way to a thick forest of hardwoods where squirrels swarmed. Ignis stood in a blueberry bush and picked the berries.\n\n\"Thus, I hid in the wilds of the Basque Country for about five months, feeding on herbs, berries and mushrooms.\"\n\n\"Until the royal army discovered me and brought me to the dungeon for treason without any trial or evidence, accusing me of selling state secrets to the sworn enemies of our people, the Applers. I would have defended myself and tried to explain the king's treachery to them, but they captured me in my sleep and ripped out my tongue; I will never be able to bewitch people again.\"\n\nGuards dressed in the royal garb, a scarlet garb streaked with purple appeared before Ignis who was sleeping, lying in the grass. They grabbed him and ripped out his tongue, a tongue of green wood. Then they tied him up and carried him away.\n\n\"Today is the day of my execution and I would like that the one who reads my story reveal the king\u2019s secrets and gather followers.\"\n\n*Nice story but my family is more important...*\n\n\"In the other pages of this diary you will find all the magical knowledge I discovered and could not conjure to save my life. Study them! This is my last wish!\"\n\nOh, magical spells? It ain\u2019t  just a story. Wait, I can summon and speak with animals and manipulate fire and heat\u2026. Plus I can control plants. Maybe, I\u2019m gonna do what you ask me, Ignis. Dad always said that I should be grateful to the one who helps me...\n\nHe only had to say this sentence to summon an animal. Animaux, que vous \u00eates g\u00e9niaux.\u00bb. The animal could choose to answer or not Oak\u2019s call.\n\nTo manipulate fire and heat, Ignis gave him these instructions.\n\n\"Rub your hands together while you say the words  \u201cMurmures, br\u00fblures, destruction, combustion, flamma aeternam\n\n\"Then manipulate the flames and model them with your thoughts, there\u2019s no limit to this, if only to the fertility of your imagination, you\u2019ll  find some ideas here\" the wizard murmured exposing representations of fireballs and flame beings, the elementals.\"\n\nTo make plants grow, Oak could alter the biological parameters of the flora. He could play with the levels of phytohormones, such as abscisic acid, auxins, cytokinins, ethylene, Gibberellin and brassinosteroids.\n\n\"Speak the following words to look inside the organism and change its different phytohormone levels.\" :\n\n\u00ab Grant la plante une graine de la plaine. \u00bb\n\nYou can also invert the formula \u201cGrant la plaine une graine de la plante\u201d in order to transform yourself into a nature elemental but only use this inversion as a last resort because after 15 minutes, the consequences are terrible.\n\n*Terrible consequences... What could be more terrible than losing your family forever*? Xidor... if you hurt them, I'll kill ya... Where are you hiding them?\n\nOak had taken all night to read the book by moonlight. His crumpled shirt and jeans and his hair were full of dust. The light of dawn was beginning to penetrate the tower and he saw another individual sleeping in the cell.\n\nHis skin was similar to the bark of a Baobab tree and his hair looked like a bush with burgundy and purple leaves. This one was laying on the slate floor and slept like a stump.\n\nOak woke him up by shaking his arm.\n\n\"Wake up, gotta get out of here before the guards wake up.\"\n\nThe other prisoner opened his eyes, yawned and introduced himself.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Willow and you are?\"\n\nOak walked over to the window where the wind was coming from.\n\n\"Oak. We\u2019re gonna talk later. We're leaving.\"\n\nOak cast a spell to call a firebird. \u201cAnimaux que vous \u00eates g\u00e9niaux\u201d\n\nFirebirds got their name from the beautiful orange-red plumage they sported, looking suspiciously like flames.\n\n*You called me?\"* a voice answered Oak telepathically.\n\n*Yeah, I absolutely need your help, firebird.*\n\n*I'm on my way, Papa Oak.*\n\n\"What's going on?\" said Willow, wondering as he saw Oak waiting there without uttering a word.\n\n\"A few minutes,\" Oak replied.\n\nSo they waited in silence for a while until they heard wings flapping in the sky. A firebird came to the window.\n\nThe firebird entered the room through the rectangular hole.\n\n\"Is that who you were waiting for?\" said Willow, his wooden eyebrows furrowed.\n\n\"Yes, ride with me on his back.\" .\n\nOak and Willow clung to the bird's back, a back covered with orange, fluffy feathers. Oak steered the bird toward the birch and Cedar forest nearby. They landed near a small pond whose blue water sparkled in the sun.\n\n\"Wow, Oak. How did you do that?\" said Willlow, surprised.\n\n\"No time to explain, we'll just drink and go,\" said Oak, quenching his thirst.\n\nA few minutes later, the soldiers noticed their absence and rang the bells to warn the others. They set out after them.\n\nAs they bent over to drink, the two prisoners heard the clatter of iron boots. A massive, handsome caudillo surrounded by about sixty infantrymen approached with a quick step. All of them were dressed in emerald clothes stamped with the royal seal.\n\nThe caudillo spoke to them.\n\n\u201cHello, Oak and Willow. I am Maple, infantry captain of the personal guard of Prince Atord. Prince Atord sent me to save you from his brother, King Xidor C\u00e8dre. The prince has discovered the king\u2019s crimes.\n\nOak lifted his head to see who was talking to him.\n\nSerious, the caudillo stared him straight in the eye.\n\n\"Oak, do you want to stand up to Carnivorism, join us in the war against Xidor, and avenge your family, or would you rather go looking for your loved ones? I'll understand if you'd rather find your loved ones and go back to your old life.\"\n\n\"I have to think about it...\" he said hesitantly.\n\n\"Take as much time as you need. But know that only Xidor knows where your parents are.\"\n\nWhat would ya do, Dad, to find me? Would ya search everywhere, even if it means wasting your time, or would ya get the answer from the one who knows for sure where I am? Ya wanted me to fight against Xidor, I'm sure... Ya wanted R\u00e9gis to fight against the bandits... I\u2019m gonna make you proud...\n\n\"No, I'm gonna do whatever I can  to stop the one who took my family and my old life from me. This king can and must change for good. I\u2019m gonna make sure he never hurts anyone again and I\u2019m gonna make sure he tells me where he's keeping my parents.\u201d\n\nMaple's serious face lit up with a genuine smile. \"All right, Oak, we'll thwart his plans together. The prince must be made aware of your adherence to our cause, I will send him a letter.\"\n\n\"This prince, we are talking about the same prince?\" said Willow to Oak, a touch of mockery in his voice.\n\n\"Yes, *that prince...\"* muttered Oak.\n\nMaple walked over to the firebird and stroked its feathers. \"While we wait for the prince's answer, I suggest we go hide and rest at Bouleauville\u2019s Inn.\u201d\n\n\"Good idea, it's still early. Gonna go sleep.\u201d\n\n\"Not so fast, Oak. You should let your firebird go, if you ride it, we won't be able to protect you.\u201d\n\n*So Ignis showed you how to call animals. Ah Ignis, old friend*... thought Maple.\"\n\n*You can go, Bird.* Oak said telepathically.\n\n*Bye, Papa Oak.\"* said the young bird sadly.\n\nThe bird flew away.\n\nThe detachment of soldiers joined the two characters and crossed the forest that separated them from the inn. They ended up on a commercial road.\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/submit#_ftnref1) Arbolarbres have a life expectancy of about 150 years (Except the wizards, they can live longer, 500 years +)\n\nHere is the link to the rest of the story:  [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46350/arbolarbres-chronicles--conflict-in-skyhigh-fast-paced](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46350/arbolarbres-chronicles--conflict-in-skyhigh-fast-paced)",

        "Apologies and a black thong\n\nI don\u2019t remember much of this dream.  I know that a lot happened, but besides the image of a wooded, beach path, I only remember this scene.\n\nI was talking to Megan and Derrick.  I was trying to explain my actions and feelings to them because I didn\u2019t want them to hate me anymore.  I was trying to apologize for what I did to them and for what I did to one of their best friends.  Although, I don\u2019t think that I was able to convince them to stop hating me.  \n\nThe last thing that I can remember from this dream is Megan leaning forward while wearing only a black thong and a see-through, black lace outfit.  It was either a tight dress or a bodysuit because I specifically remember the black lace covering her ass.",

        "Childhood memory. Traumatic but Funny\nI had to be at least 4 when this happened. We were living on the Cape at the time. This brings me to the side thought of how times really have changed because I was outside playing with my friend unsupervised. Yea, we were on military grounds but that means nothing. I digress. Me and my friend, I don't remember his name, started following this stray cat. We weren't allowed to have cats when I was a kid cause mom always claimed to be allergic, but I really just wanted to play with it. So we proceeded to chase it down at first but it was to fast, so we decided to follow it as slowly, and as quietly as possible for a 4 year old.  I remember thinking I could get close enough to grab it and it would just let me. My friend was right behind me. I remember him being afraid of the cat and trying to discourage my mission. I had just got the words, \"I can get it\" out of my mouth when the cat suddenly whipped around and went berserk all over me. It went to hissing and spitting, and clawing me everywhere. I was a rather tiny child and the cat was probably damn near my size. I was barely able to cover my face, but it clawed me all over my head, hands, arms, and chest. When it was over, I stood there for a moment in disbelief, just before I started screaming, and running for home, with my little screaming friend right behind me. I remember being afraid of the trouble I was gonna be in if I told my mom what I had really been doing, so even in my traumatized state of mind, I managed to manifest an entire story of how we had just been playing in the dirt when the cat came out of nowhere and attacked me. My little friend even backed up every word I said. My mom didn't completely buy it, but she didn't think I had been trying to catch it either, \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f",

Fifteenth Sister made a quick mental check of her expression. She hoped she wasn\u2019t displaying human aggression signals. Her mandibles rested in a closed but not tight position, her antennae were perked in interest, and her head was slightly tilted to the side to give her the best focus on the human.  \n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t,\u201d the human finally said.  \n\nFifteenth Sister flicked her antennae in acknowledgment. \u201cI am afraid that Amblesalong had some concerns about your health,\u201d Fifteenth Sister informed him.  \n\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d The human tightened the fleshy covering over his disconcerting single point eyes. That meant he was focusing his attention on her, waiting for further information, she remembered.  \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Fifteenth Sister went on, \u201che was concerned that you had not reported intaking enough nutrients to maintain your health.\u201d\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d the human muttered as his gaze dropped to his hands, and the smooth expanse of his forehead wrinkled in a fascinating manner.

She was increasingly grateful that their sight overlapped enough that they could share this most efficient display method. \u201cCan you confirm that these are the inputs you entered?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the human said after a moment, \u201cthat seems about right.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to this,\u201d Fifteenth Sister said, \u201cyou have consumed primarily simple, dead carbohydrates for the past three days.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the human bobbed his head vigorously in a manner that would have indicated serious neural dysfunction in a Shatar. \u201cSince the party, we\u2019ve been going through the remaining party food.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmblesalong assures me that this is a wholly inadequate diet for your species,\u201d Fifteenth Sister observed. \u201cHe even suggested that if you continued this pattern, it could start showing serious medical effects within days.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d the human raised and lowered his shoulders, \u201cthe chocolate cake is almost gone, so it\u2019ll be fine.

        "The rain stops but everything is still gray in Seattle, from the outfits on the people to sidewalks wet and grayer than before the rain began. It isn't depressing though, everything is fresh in nature and Pike Place Market is booming as it usually is on a Sunday afternoon. Me and Fernando watch a lifeless salmon together being tossed between two men that man the central seafood vender. The crowd that has formed claps and takes pictures of it.\n\n\"People come from all around to watch them do that,\" I say as we walk away.\n\n\"What a weird and interesting ritual,\" Fernando says, smiling as he takes a bite out of a meat stuffed roll.\n\n\"That it is,\" I say, smiling. \"I used to come here every summer with the family at least once, it was one of my favorite things to see them do. How are you liking your pirozhki?\"\n\n\"I'm loving it,\" he says around another bite. \"I don't think I've had anything like it before.\"\n\n\"I know right,\" I chuckle as I eat some of my own piroshki. \"It's one of my favorite things to get at Pike Place.\"\n\nI walk over to a vendor that has an array of fruits and vegetables sitting out. A sign sticking out of a pile of purple prickly dragon fruit reads \u2018ask for help.\u2019\n\n\"What would you like?\" The vendor, a black elderly woman yells over the crowd.\n\n\"Can I get one Dragon Fruit and a pound of tomatoes?\" I yell back.\n\n\"You got it kid!\" She pipes out and with quick hands she bags and weighs a pound of tomatoes and a dragon fruit. \"That'll be $21.50.\"\n\nI hand her twenty-five and she quickly hands me change and the bag of produce.\n\n\"Thank you!\" I yell.\n\nWe pass vendors selling flowers, paintings, homemade journals, and jewelry as we make our way through with the crowd. My mind wonders as Fernando takes in every little detail around us. I think of this morning and the crescent shaped scar I came across, the way it sent shock waves through my body when I touched it. It looked newly formed, not even a day old and I try to think if I felt it as we made out last night on my couch or if I even glimpsed it.\n\nThere are way too many weird things about Fernando and yet every time I look at him it all washes away somehow. Even the thought of him places me at ease. Deep down, even though it had been just yesterday since we met, I was falling in love with him. It felt as though I could spend an eternity with him, that my body was his body and his body was my body.\u00a0\n\nThat we were everything to each other.\n\nFernando grabs my hand and pulls me through the crowd and out a pair of double doors held open. We emerge on an open terrace where people lounge about, watching over a windy fall view of the Sound.\n\nEven though the sky was grey, the scene before us was anything but stunning from the people walking about below us on the waterfront to the distant tree coated crests of land and islands that blocked the straight away view of open pacific waters.\n\n\u201cWhat's that large white thing?\u201d Fernando asks, pulling me to a spot that just opened up at the wooden wailing. \u201cSome kind of ship?\u201d\n\nI follow his pointing finger to a white ferry cutting its way across the soft gray waves.\n\nHow could he be twenty-eight and not know that? I thought. But then again maybe it's just another cultural difference that makes Fernando, Fernando. The man I was falling more in love with with every passing second.\n\n\u201cYeah...it's a ferry,\u201d I say as he frowns and concentrates on the ship's steady progress to one of the distant islands.\n\n\u201cIt's so huge,\u201d he murmurs.\n\n\u201cHas to be,\u201d I say. \u201cIt's holding hundreds of people and cars aboard it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCars are on it?\u201d he gasps. \u201cThat's crazy! I could never imagine a funny looking ship like that.\u201d\n\nI watch him and he turns to meet my eyes, a smile across his face. There is so much joy and innocence on his angular features and I can\u2019t help myself but to lean in and kiss him.\n\nOur arms wrap around each other and the world seems to wash away during our five second kiss. When our lips part I look into his eyes, taking in the intricate design of his green irises with flicks of hazel. His dimples pop out with the crinkles of his smile as his tongue runs across his upper lip. Overhead a seagull cries out as it glides, riding the currents in the air and flapping its long wings every now and then. His forehead gently touches mine and I close my eyes, taking in his scent of roses and pines, a near constant presence of him that has added itself to a list of things that I love about him, next to his weirdness and the wonder he holds for the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we met,\u201d he says. \u201cThat second I walked into the Donkey Shoe, I was blown away by just a glimpse of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's hard to imagine it going any other way,\u201d I say. \u201cHow many more days are you in Bellingham?\u201d\n\n\u201cA couple more days,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it might be longer. I don\u2019t think I have an excuse to want to never come back or even to want to leave. With you it feels like I\u2019ve known you for half a century.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat feeling,\u201d I say. \u201cIt's something I've felt since we first kissed. Like our bodies and souls just seemed to match like two halves of a puzzle coming together much the stars earth meeting on the tip of the horizon. This just seems so unreal.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch like a dream,\u201d he says, staring into my eyes as people talk about us with words that have no need for our attention. \u201cI never thought I would find someone like you in all my life.\u201d\n\nThe air shakes as a crackling breaks through the area and the people about us run. A flash of light plays in the air as I scream in Fernandos arms, my face buried in his neck.\n\n\u201cIt's okay,\u201d Fernando whispers into my ear and I look around.\n\nStanding before us are five people dressed in robes with the same brown complexion as Fernando and I. We are alone on the terrace and it seems the whole of the market, from what I can see through the double doors they block, is empty.\n\n\u201cFernando,\u201d a figure says, the leader I believe. \u201cYou have nowhere to go. Come back home with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what will be of him, Rodger?\u201d Fernando asks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll have to come along, Fernando,\u201d the man named Roger says.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t let that happen,\u201d Fernando shakes his head, his body trembling. \u201cYou know what they will do to him and to me for bonding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do know,\u201d Rodger says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I have to do this, my friend, but they will have my head if I return without you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The five cloaked figures raise their palms and I scream as chains of ice shoot them towards us at a rapid speed. One of my own hands shot out and flames burst from its palm, melting the chains of ice as Rodger and his men form shields before them for protection.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFuck,\u201d Fernando swears, holding me still as I look at my hand in horror.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat the fuck was that!\u201d I gasp.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt's okay love,\u201d he says as the cloaked figures' shields vanish and Rodger watches us in disgust. \u201cJust hold on to me and don\u2019t panic.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sight of Seattle and a burning Pike Place Market washes away from my vision as Rodger screams in rage and we stand back in my studio apartment. Fernando moves to let me go but my legs are jelly and he catches me before I fall and hit my head on the littered coffee table.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt's all okay,\u201d he says as he lays me on the couch. \u201cLet me get you some water.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d I say and grab his wrist. \u201cYou are going to explain everything to me right now, Fernando.\u201d",

        "Was in kauai at a place called Queens bath, it's like a bunch of pools of water from when ocean is high tide or low tide idk the difference.(look it up its really cool) You basically chill like a pool but the bottom is all rocks. Anyway me and my buddy were chatting with a random guy who happened to live a city away from us in California. Ended up chatting with him for a bit then he lost his ring and we all looked for it but couldn't find it. So the next day me and my buddy brought our goggles there to find it and after only about 10 minutes my buddy somehow found it, was gonna post on Facebook when we got back to California. The guy ended up being on the same flight as me and when I saw him I yelled super loud \"I HAVE YOUR RING\" He laughed and said yea right. Then I pulled it out and he got super excited. The ring was just a scratched up metal band, but he was so grateful because it was the original ring he got on his wedding day like 30 years ago",
        "So this happed When I was 7 years old I lived in Houston Texas With my Parents and my uncle lives 20 minutes away. My parents went on a Business trip so I stayed with my Cousin and my uncle and his wife. At 2 PM in the afternoon I was watching tv with my cousin and My uncle wife (I\u2019m going to name her Hannah) I never had a problem with her over the years btw. So she called me and told me to lay my hands on the bed and bend over so I did that and got my ass whooped for no reason. ( probably because I was Arab) When my uncle came back She and him were fighting than she throw the ring at him than they filed a divorce than she got 2 months of jail because of Child abuse but my uncle managed to tell to judge to make it 2 months \nSo that\u2019s my story lol",

People cannot invest negatively on one\u2019s misfortune/errors/bad judgement here, here let\u2019s call this hedging.)\n\nHaving said the above, the people who have made money again and again, and for quite some time now can do so without wasting others\u2019 time and effort, usually they like teaching their abilities to others, as whatever abilities practical/social/in designing they have, those abilities are balanced for what they do\u2026but better here to use three examples:\n\nThe craftsman has practical abilities to do something, something a craftsman has done for quite some time, and something a craftsman would like others to also honor if they like it, and so a craftsman teaches it to others.\n\nThe soul of the party has practical abilities doing something with others, something with others the soul of the party has done for quite some time, and others around the soul of the party learn how to do it on their own just by being around\u2026the soul of the party\u2026as even if the soul of the party if fading, if the a party is still around it, the ones around are partying, and either they learn from experience, or they also fade and then the party goes elsewhere.\n\nThe designer has practical abilities doing something else than what the designer initially imagined, as a real designer can really design in reality, and the designer learns that only with real experience, spending time and effort again\u2026and again\u2026and\u2026again\u2026for each design delivered in the end\u2026that in the end the designer can only hope that the design is balanced in reality\u2026as this is the only place that the designer can find out if a design is realizable.\n\n**\u201cWhich are the mechanisms to achieve this goal\u201d**\n\nLearning is one part of the solution to the problem of achieving this goal, but here the other part is\u2026\n\nIn reality you have people who cannot make money again and again without wasting others\u2019 time and effort, and those people can be:\n\nUnwilling:  They do not want to learn using their own free will, or\n\nWilling: They want to learn using their own free will, or\n\nWhat willing?

        "\n\n'Watch your back, cos Kelpie Black is looking out for you!\"\n\nNot everyone knows the tragic tale of this mysterious and sinister figure.\nWas it just a far off rumour, lost in the mists of time, or did the character exist, I don't think anyone will ever know for sure now too much time has passed for anyone to know.\n\nHere are the few titbits of fact (or fiction) which are still available to those who care, and who know where to look.\n\nThere once was an evil woman who lived on the outskirts of a friendly little Town, nobody knew her real name (indeed could get near her safely enough to enquire what her name was without getting seriously physically attacked), so the Townsfolk gave her the nickname of \"Kelpie Black\" after her malicious, malevolent attitude and her often seen shrouded appearance.\n\nNot that the Townsfolk taunted nor teased \"Kelpie Black\", not even the children of the Town participated in this common youthful activity, it was too much trouble.\n\nThe people of this small Town were very good, kind decent hard-working citizens. I say this with no tone of irony or sarcasm, the people were just as I say they were, helping the less fortunate members of the community without a thought of gain for themselves.\n\nOn many occasions, the Townspeople tried to offer the hand of friendship to \"Kelpie Black\" by taking food baskets to her dark, decrepit hovel in the woods, or by inviting her to join in with the numerous Town's activities only to be scornfully mocked, spat on and viciously assaulted\u00a0\n\nThe trouble was that the young people and children started to disappear mysteriously in and around the vicinity of the evil woman's old shack in the woods, and the Townsfolk soon came to some unpleasant conclusions about the fate of their youths.\n\nKnowing they needed proof of their conclusions, a small group of men quietly and stealthily entered the woods to see if they could find proof\u2026\n\nThey found bones, lots of bones, and children's clothes, animal skeletons and small human bones.\n\nThere was nothing that the Townsfolk could do but exile the wicked crone, without firm evidence to convict her and not knowing what else to do to protect their remaining offspring,\u00a0 they banished \"Kelpie Black\" from her ominous home forever.\n\nThe evil woman was incandescent with rage and cut up rough (quite understandably maybe), but when threatened with the Constable unless she left quietly, started to shuffle away, turning back, her ebony soulless eyes burning with vengeful, cruel fire.\n\"From here on out, I curse this wretched Town, and everyone in it; all your brats will die before five and ten, all will shrivel and wither!\"\u00a0\nWith that, she gave a horrific cackle and shuffled off, watched by the mortified Townsfolk.\n\nThe legend started with this School playground rhyme that the children of the small Town used to sing to each other as a way to scare their friends and enemies alike.\nThe rest of the rhyme has been forgotten or lost along with the last of the children who sang It.\n\n\nGenerations passed, and the legend of \"Kelpie Black\"\u00a0 took over from reality.\nIt wasn't a man nor a woman either, it had no gender or identity, just a malignant, malicious presence that haunted and claimed the woods and waters of the area surrounding the Town\n\nChildren drowned a lot in that area, at that time but it was only the children from the small Town in question that came back from their watery graves in the dead of night and in the name of \"Kelpie Black\" taunted their living, grieving loved ones and feasted on the flesh of any unsuspecting and misfortunate soul who stumbled across them. (Usually, drunks who made the bad choice to take the short route home beside the River and unlucky infants whose foolish parents left the windows of the bedrooms open for some good old fresh air.\n\nWhat the poor misguided Mother and Father discovered the following morning does not need to be dwelled upon but we can all guess what morbid, gruesome scene greeted them on entering their baby's room.\n\n\n\nNow, we come to our heroes (if there are any) of our tale;). The Miller family members consisted of Grandmother Louisa her Son Harry, Daughter in law Jo-Jo and their four children Jocelyn, 11, Sapphire 9, Rhuna 6 and baby Joanna who was 18 months at the time.\n\nJocelyn, being the only Son of his Mother and Father took his role very seriously and after coming face to face with several of the adolescent ghouls coming home from School late one dark, cold Winter's afternoon and only surviving because he (like a lot of children) had matches in his satchel, contraband that most likely saved his life.\u00a0\nGhouls are terrified of fire.\n\nHe concluded that he and his three little Sisters could not be safe unless something was done, so he told his Grandmother of his fears, and his beloved elder in return gave Jocelyn some very handy tips\n\nOn a night Harry and Jo-Jo were away and the four Miller children were all snug and cosy in the small cottage under the protection of their Grandmother, the ghoulish youngsters made their attack:\nHowever, Jocelyn and Louisa had a counter-attack of their own.\n\n(Unbeknownst to the adolescent flesh-eaters, Granny Miller came from an ancient family from the old Country whose people conversed and bargained with the archaic deities as freely as we might greet our neighbours good day.\n\nSo a few days before this fearful, endless night; the old lady rose early at dawn and walked down to the Riverbank with her wicker basket laden with offerings for the Lady Boann, Goddess of the River.\n\nGranny Miller laid out her offerings of milk, grain and plant \"mead wort\" on the Riverbank and spoke in a solemn yet bright tone.\n\"I give these meagre offerings to you, Boann, Goddess of the River Boyne; in return, I ask for your aid to rid this Town of the darkness that is \"Kelpie Black\" and to protect my family from the evil which comes with it, Boann of the white cow, I call upon you!\")\n\n\nIt began with a quite gentle rap on the door\n\u201dGranny Miller, open the door, let us in, we are cold and hungry!\"\n\nJocelyn had readied Sapphire for her task a good time before they heard the thin, eerie, unreal voices at their front door and even though her small pretty face was alabaster and she was shaking like a leaf, she had the same look of sombre determination she had when they were playing chess and he was reassured by that.\n\nTheir Grandmother picked up baby Joanna and took Rhuna by the hand and led them to her bedroom which was the room furthest away from the front door.\n\"Now, your job is to stay here, hold the baby, and to keep saying out loud \u2026\"\n\"Please protect us, Boann, Goddess of the River!\"\nThe little girl finished smiling sweetly\u00a0\n\n\"That's my clever girl!\"\nGrandmother Miller stroked her small Granddaughter's face and left shutting the door behind her,\u00a0\n\n\"Granny Miller, it's Jenny Brown and Adam Morgan, please let us in, it's so cold out here!\"\nThe ghostly voices echoed around the cosy cottage-like wind through the eaves.\n\n\"Are you ready, children?! We need to be fast, it's a matter of life and death!\"\nThe children just nodded, looking nervous but committed.\nWith that, Granny Miller took up her place behind the door and said clearly \u2026\n\"Come in children, the door is unlocked!\"\n\nThe seconds dragged on horribly, before the front door slowly, almost painfully creaked, first ajar, then completely open.\n\nJocelyn heard himself gasp, at the sight of their former Schoolmates; but he was soon pulled free from his stupor by the screams and actions of his Sister Sapphire.\n\nThe next minutes passed by like a whirlwind of sensations; colours sounds and smells whirled by as if seen on one of those locomotives Jocelyn had read about in the books at School,\u00a0\n\nThey worked in unison, the three of them. \nThe moment Jocelyn heard his Sister's screams and saw her and their Grandmother's actions, he too jumped into action and their screams of disgust and terror soon became war cries of rage and defiance.\n\nIn a flash, and what seemed like extraordinary strength, their Grandmother launched the sack of salt that they had purchased earlier, (and that they both had to help her carry home) at the ghoulish youngsters and at the same time Sapphire and Jocelyn fired the contents of their catapults towards the undead children.\n\nBy the sound of the enraged howls and screams of pure agony, the catapults struck their target with precision\n\nOutside, a nasty storm was blowing the World upside down, the screams of the hideous youngster's competed (and lost) with the harsh wails and scaling whoops and howls of the storm building to a crescendo outside.\n\nThe ghouls were obviously caught unawares by the counter-attack by the Miller family, they hissed and snarled like wild dogs, but to the surprise of Sapphire and Jocelyn, they started to back out of the small dwelling, acrid smoke rising from them.\n\nThe Miller children quickly reloaded their catapults with more silver coins and fired at the retreating demonic juveniles.\nA second later and they were gone altogether, it was as if they were never there\n\nThe atmosphere changed in the air, it became lighter, cleaner. \nWith the coming of the storm came something else, something immense, neither good nor bad but ancient.\nGrandmother Miller quickly slammed the door shut and latched it in one fell swoop\n\"My bravest, clever children!\nShe said opening her arms to Sapphire and Jocelyn and they ran straight to her, without hesitation.\n\n\"Fetch your Sisters, I shall make tea and toast and fire; we still need to be cautious until we can be certain!\"\n\n\nLater, when they were all sitting around the fire drinking piping hot tea and listening to the fierce storm and other more ominous sounds outside baby Joanna asleep in her basket. Jocelyn had to wonder whether their plan was a success.\nHis Grandmother wondered the same and didn't sleep at all that night.\n\n\n\nThe next morning was a bright crisp Winter's one, and there was a great commotion in the happy little Town;\nThe two older Miller children went outside to see what all the fuss was about.\n\nThey both hurried back home when they saw what everyone else was in awe of\n'Gran, Gran, come and see the River, come and see!\"\nBoth Jocelyn and Sapphire cried out beyond excitement.\n\nGrandmother Miller took baby Joanna in her arms and Jocelyn held Rhuna's tiny hand and they all followed Sapphire back out to where the other Townsfolk were gathered.\n\nThe image that confronted Grandmother Miller took the old lady's breath away.\nThe ancient River that had run through their little Town for as long as anyone could remember was bone dry as arid as a desert\u00a0\n\nAt the bottom of the dried-up Riverbed lay mouldering and rotten like a mummy's bandages was what looked like a long black shroud.",
        "I was telling a co-worker this ridiculous story today and figured I should share this with the reddit world now that I'm freshly addicted.  It's a long story, but I promise you'll enjoy the hell out of it.  This happened back in 2010 during the last month of my senior year of high school.\n\nA tiny bit of backstory: I was in my school's drumline (I was captain too) in high school, and during band class we practiced on drumpads in the hallway outside the band room.  We frequently pulled stupid pranks on one another during practices, both during school hours and after school.  It was just part of being in the drumline.\n\nWell... on one particular occasion during band class early in the school day a couple of my friends decided they wanted to \"pants\" me while I was drumming (that's when you randomly sneak up behind someone and pull their pants/shorts down).  Don't worry... it was just the shorts (not underwear).  Little did I realize... one of my friends was filming it on his phone. \n\nSo they went ahead and pulled my shorts down while I was practicing and it was funny, and we all laughed, and I even saw the short video my friend took on his flip phone.  I figured he was going to delete it shortly after, and didn't think much of it...\n\nTHEN, during my AP Physics class, last period of the school day, I get called down to the Dean's office (Dean of Discipline).  Everyone in the classroom was confused as hell, including my teacher.  By that point in my high school career, I was already known as one of the top 10 ranked students of our graduating class, I was actively tutoring students in Chemistry, AP Chemistry, and Physics after school, I was a super nerdy/nice kid... taking four AP courses at the time (those are college-level courses taken in high school). I was literally the polar opposite of a troublemaker.\n\nSo I head to the Dean's office.  The dean holds up a flip phone and asks, \"Is this you in this video?\"  And he plays the clip my friend took during band class.  \"Yes\" I replied.  Then he asks, \"Did you tell any teachers about this happening?\" Me: \"No, it was just a drumline prank, we pull stupid pranks on each other in drumline all the time - we're all close friends.  It's really no big deal.\"  Then I get sent back to physics class.  \n\nOn the way I saw one of my drumline friends heading in the opposite direction towards the Dean's office.  I asked what happened, and he said the drummer with the flip phone got caught in his history class showing a friend the video of [me] getting \"pants'd\" and the teacher confiscated his phone and immediately started treating it like a bullying/sexual harassment case.  So now I was thinking \"oh shit, my drumline friends are all about to get in a ton of trouble... over something that's getting blown WAY out of proportion...\"\n\nThen I get called to the Dean's office AGAIN during physics.  Everyone's still like \"what the hell is going on?\" including my teacher.  I sit down with the Dean in his office, and he tells me this: \n\n\"So, we were going to suspend you for 3 days, but decided to cut it down to a 1-day suspension... for Indecent Exposure.\"  To which I said \"Wait... WHAT?!\"  Then he went on to explain that because I never complained to any teachers about what happened, that flip phone video of me getting \"pants'd\" was technically equivalent to me \"intentionally dropping my pants in front of the whole school,\" because that video could have been shown to anyone.  I couldn't believe it... I was honestly terrified how my dad would receive this.\n\nThis was on a Thursday.  My first question to the Dean after that was \"I'm in four AP courses right now... what am I going to do about my classwork/homework I'm supposed to get for those classes tomorrow, and for the weekend?\"  He said: \"Well, you could come in after school hours and get your schoolwork from your teachers then...\" (blah de blah).  I replied, \"I'll just go talk to them now... thanks.\"\n\nAfter I told my AP teachers what happened, they were all absolutely furious with the school's administration for suspending me that they exempted me from ALL coursework assigned that Friday AND the weekend.  They did that because they knew I \"would've gotten all the work done anyway\" and that I really wasn't missing much.\n\nMy physics teacher even said \"chances are you'll be tutoring kids on this stuff next week anyway who actually do need the practice.  Enjoy the 3-day weekend because you deserve it anyway.  And by the way... f*** that front office.\"  That comment from him made me feel so much better about it.\n\nFortunately my dad wasn't too furious... he knew I basically got screwed and none of that was my fault.  Literally my only way out of that mess was to rat all my drumline friends out and whine to a teacher about it when it happened... over a stupid prank that was for friendly laughs.  I would have turned all of my friends against me if I did that... and that to me would have been a much worse ending to this story.  I'll gladly take the 3-day weekend instead.  Haha.  *End of story*\n\nHope you all enjoyed that ridiculousness - I sure did when it happened, hahaha :)",
        " \n\nGreetings, everyone!\n\nMy  name is Francesco Vujicevic and I am from Italy. Just as the title  reads, I am 16 years old and have managed to get two books published,  the first in 2018 in Italian by a Milan-based publishing house and the  second yesterday in English by Amazon. Truth to be told, out of  excitement, I was about to promote the latter around writing subreddits without even glancing  at their rules first. My apologies!\n\nTherefore,  I thought about sharing my story with you guys, of how I managed to  take my immense passion for writing to the next level. Simly put, at 13,  when I concluded that my writing skills had gotten good and consistent  enough, I put heart and soul into a project of mine, intent to make my  dream of becoming a proper author come true - succeeding. My first  novel, Gentiluomo Assassino, a horror-thriller, was finally published in  October 2019 in bookshops and online after a crowdfunding campaign,  selling more than five hundred copies across the country. It was very  well-received overall, and I even had several exhibitions in stores and  schools in my city before the pandemic came into play.\n\nThen,  in early 2021, I dediced to translate my work myself with the help of a  Scottish friend of mine, while also \"remastering\" it in order to  fulfill the age/maturity gap between Gentiluomo Assassino and this new  version. And so, The Killer Gentleman was born after substantial  revisions and additions, also featuring illustrations! In the end, it's  been a lengthy yet fun journey, and I look forward to amaze readers all  across the globe. Spreading the word with your family and friends would  mean the world to a young author like me. Cheers!\n\nThe  only advice I wish to give other aspiring writers reading this is to  NEVER give up. I was lucky enough to have my book accepted by a  publishing house on my first try, back in 2018. But if it were to be  rejected, I would have definitely tried with another whilst considering  improvements on my work, trying to imagine what did not work out as I  expected. If you *truly* believe  in a project of yours, treat it as if it were a plant. Let it grow,  strengthen the roots, and don't let others shamelessly step on it,  thinking that it's worth nothing at all. I met middle-aged men who  believed my book had zero effort put into it and that my parents had  made it all up just for me to sell. Fully grown adults, yes.\n\nBut  I did not care. And now here I am. Everyone has their own times and  reasons for getting to do what they love, and although the latter  becoming their full-time occupation is a challenging task it can always  happen regardless, with enough dedication and effort.\n\nIf anyone is interested, here's the link to purchase a copy of The Killer Gentleman: [https://www.amazon.com/Killer-Gentleman-Francesco-Vujicevic/dp/B09JJKH6QD/ref=tmm\\_pap\\_swatch\\_0?\\_encoding=UTF8&qid=1634747739&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Killer-Gentleman-Francesco-Vujicevic/dp/B09JJKH6QD/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1634747739&sr=8-1)\n\nI have also made a book trailer featuring famous voice actor Gianni Matragrano: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjNxuxXE7BE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjNxuxXE7BE)",
        "Hello from Turkey! There is a German teacher in our school, and she has absolutely no idea of how to keep control of the class. As in every class, there is a kid in our class that everybody hates. And even his sister hates him.\n\nI was chilling at the corridor, where we have our cabinets to store our stuff, I see this kid and his face is covered in his own blood! Im like \"What the hell happened to you!?\" \"Oh this? Yeah my sister tried to take out my eye.\"\n\nI think you understand how much everyone dislikes him.\n\nIf you are thinking \"Wow he must be alone, why is everyone so mean to him?\", Heres a everyday situation with this kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo there are class levels in German, for example A1,A2,B1,B2 etc... I go to B1 with this kid.\n\nMan I dont know where to begin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is a real attention freak. Our teacher was showing us some clips about everyday situations and he pretends to be asleep; no one notices. He moves his arms around; no one notices. Then he starts \"snoring\" to get attention. Even louder than the video we were watching. Teacher simply does fkn nothing, and says \"Leise bitte\" (quiet please!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome time passes, we are taking a test on our books and randomly someone stands up and screams \"ALLAH U EKBER\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHE DOES THIS SO OFTEN, I SAID PLEASE EXPLODE US ALL IM TIRED OF THIS SH\\*T.\n\nTeacher? Leise bitte again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou remember his sister I mentioned earlier? The both siblings are in the same class. He once got up to PULL HIS SISTERS HAIR. And she naturally screams in pain. My ears bleed, the teacher, YEP YOU GUESSED IT BOI, \"LEISE BITTE.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou may say the kid has a problem, but no. Its poor parenting. Imagine a parent that buys a new phone every 4 month, and hire a special driver cuz they dont want to drive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday I was sitting, tired of his sh\\*t and then he grabs my pencil case, tries to peel off the characters on it. I was so pissed at him so I got up the chair and punched him at the same time. Then he proceeds to scream like a mofoggin Perodactyle and OH YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT THE TEACHER DOES AHHAHAHHA \"LEISE BITTE\" AGAIN.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd oh boy, he likes to flex. He takes his phone from the teacher, saying he has to call his mom. I was drawing a nice pixel art car and BOOM an Iphone lands on my desk.

So I guess Ill try screaming Bismillah to the teacher like this guy and learn a few stuff XD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOpen for your toughts, thanks for ur time :)",
        " \n\nSo one day I was chilling with my beautiful girlfriend (we were both wearing fursuits) when some KAREN tried to stop us injecting heroin. She then broke my arm and pushed me to the floor. My girlfriend then chose this moment to reveal that she was breaking up with me. I then walked over to the pharmacy but it was being shot up. I jumped on the robber and I had the element of surprise due to my fursuit. The robber, in the struggle, shot an old lady and she just lay there bleeding. Because of the guilt of shooting a defenceless old woman, the robber blew his brains out. I searched for cough medication but they were out, making my trip to the pharmacy pointless. As soon as I stepped out, a bodybuilder ran up, picked me up by the torso and threw me down a manhole. I landed in the sewer and got washed away by the current of sewage water. I ended up in an underground chapel. I decided to go to sleep on the ground there and when I woke up, I was safe and sound in my bed. My girlfriend was also with me in the bed and when I asked her what was up with her being there when we weren't together anymore she said she didn't know what I was talking about. Confused, I went to open the door to the hallway but outside was just an empty void. I turned around and saw the KAREn from the start of this insane turn of events but she was MADE OF GOLD. My girlfriend and I then started to make out. When I nutted in her, she started to remember.\n\n\"It has been transferred,\" she said, before sinking into the ground.\n\nI then woke up once again on the top of the World Trade Centre, September 11 2001. I jumped from the top of the building and once again landed in my girlfriend's loving arms.\n\nThis is a true story. Even the worst of days can be remedied when you have a loving partner.",

        "[YouTube Narrated version](https://youtu.be/Jkm7-cTAEAE)\n\nAt some point in history, there were three billy goats who were brothers. They were the Billy goats gruff. \n\nThe youngest was a small white one, with tiny horns. \n\nThere was a medium sized brown one with medium sized horns \n\nThen the eldest was an enormous black one, with giant curly horns. \n\nThey all lived on a meadow and ate grass all day. For months they would stuff their faces, until their bellies were beyond full. Such was the greed of the billy goats Gruff.  \n\nHowever, after some time they noticed the grass they were eating was becoming browner and browner. Dryer and dryer. Shorter and shorter. If they kept on eating here at the rate they were going, they would soon starve. \n\nIn the distance, across the river and over a rickety bridge, they could see a beautiful garden, with the greenest grass they had ever seen. Day after day they longed for the greener grass in that field. The problem was the garden was guarded and watered by a mean troll. If they tried to cross the river, the troll would eat them!  \n\nOne day, the goats had enough. The little one spoke up \u201cI\u2019m going to go across the bridge and eat that grass. I can\u2019t eat another mouthful of this dry brown grass\u201d. So off he went. \n\nTrip Trap, Trip Trap, over the bridge. \n\nWhen he got to the end of the bridge, the Troll suddenly ran towards him and bellowed \n\n\u201cWho do you think you are, trying to get over my bridge and into my garden! I\u2019m going to eat you all gone!\u201d \n\nThe little billy goat gruff was scared and hungry, but he had a plan. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat me! I am small and hungry. Perhaps if you let me across and eat from your garden, one of my brothers will see how kind you are and follow as well. My brothers are much bigger than I am, so would be a better meal for you.\u201d \n\nThe troll thought about this, his tummy also rumbling, and said \u201cSounds like a plan. Go on into my garden\u201d So off the little billy goat gruff set. Trip Trap, Trip Trap, into the Trolls garden. \n\nSure enough, the medium sized billy goat gruff saw his younger brother in the garden with the green, green grass and was immediately jealous. \u201cIf he can convince the troll, then so can I\u201d he said to his eldest, then off he went.  \n\nTrip Trap, Trip Trap, over the bridge. \n\nWhen he got to the end of the bridge, the Troll suddenly ran towards him and bellowed \n\n\u201cWho do you think you are, trying to get over my bridge and into my garden! I\u2019m going to eat you up and save the leftovers for my lunch!\u201d \n\nThe medium sized billy goat gruff was nervous, but he also had a plan. \n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what my youngest brother told you, but most of my size is bone. I wouldn\u2019t make a good meal for you. However, if you let me cross and into your garden, my eldest brother will be sure to follow. He is a greedy beast, full of fat and muscle, so would make a much tastier meal for you.\u201d \n\nThe troll laughed, as the brothers were clearly playing against each other, but he decided to follow along \u201cThat sounds reasonable. Go on then, go into the garden\u201d So off the medium sized billy goat gruff set. Trip Trap, Trip Trap, into the Trolls garden. \n\nThe eldest had been watching the entire time, his tummy grumbling and his mind racing with thought of eating. \u201cIf they can convince him, then as the oldest and wisest, I should have no trouble\u201d So off he went. \n\nTrip Trap, Trip Trap, over the bridge. \n\nWhen he got to the end of the bridge, the Troll suddenly ran towards him and bellowed \n\n\u201cWho do you think you are, trying to get over my bridge and into my garden! I\u2019m going to serve you up as a week-long feast for my friends and family.\u201d The goat was big! The troll licked his lips, wiping away the droll from seeing the large goat before him. \n\nThe enormous goat snapped back at the troll \u201cYou will not eat me! If you try, I\u2019ll knock you into the river with my big horns!\u201d The troll looked startled \u201cOk, Ok! Don\u2019t harm me. How about you join your brothers in my garden, then you all never cross over my bridge again?\u201d \n\nThe eldest thought about this briefly, for he was so hungry and wanting to eat, he would agree to anything. Tomorrows food was tomorrows problem \u201cThat sounds fair. Thank you for letting us all go into your garden today.\u201d  \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite alright, it\u2019s my pleasure\u201d Said the troll, smiling from ear to ear. So off the enormous sized billy goat gruff set. Trip Trap, Trip Trap, into the Trolls garden. \n\nThe enormous billy goat gruff joined his brothers. Looking down as the juicy, green grass he said \u201cDelicious, finally some decent food\u201d then went to bite down on the grass. \n\nYuk! \n\nIt wasn\u2019t real grass at all! It was plastic! Fake Grass! \n\nThe little billy goat gruff turned to his brothers, tears in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s all my fault\u201d \n\nThe enormous sized billy goat gruff said \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll just head back to our field\u201d \n\nThe Medium sized billy goat gruff piped up \u201cWe can\u2019t, we are trapped here!\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Exclaimed the enormous billy goat gruff, before seeing the traps both of his brothers had their feet caught in. In this moment, he went into a hunger-fuelled rage and went to charge at the troll. \n\nUnfortunately, he tripped a trap, covering him in a giant net. The troll came over, gloating \u201cYou should have stayed on your field, rather than wanting the greener grass on mine.\u201d \n\nWith that, the troll took all the goats inside and made quite the feast for his friends and family. He even had enough for lunch the next day. \n\n*************************** \n\nThe moral of this story? The grass may look greener on the other side, but beware the risks that it may entail. It may look better than your current situation, yet it could be a deception to trick you into being a benefit to someone else.",

I just want to answer a question that was raised by observing what I assume was a recreational behavior among the field workers on the evening shift.\u201d  \n\nThe base commander considered this carefully. Even allowing passive research on a sapient species could raise tensions on a small base like this. However humans were notoriously curious and willing to be studied. On the other flap, they usually insisted on being able to study whoever was studying them in turn, and that could lead down very disruptive wind gusts. He ran a winghook over his sensory horns and nodded slowly as he pondered.\n\n\u201cI will have to discuss this with Third Cousin,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we decide in your favor, she will send you the files this afternoon.\u201d\n\nThe Trisk nodded and skittered quickly out of the room. It was a fairly simple matter to contact Third Cousin and get her to agree to a meeting, but the meeting had to be delayed as she was quite busy in the medical bay. The base commander pulled up the medical records and blinked in surprise. It seemed that roughly half of the human population of the base was currently slated for minor medical attention. The symptoms showed a fascinating range from minor burns to bruises to one dislocated shoulder joint. The base commander winced and rolled his shoulder joints in sympathy. This was perplexing but hardly out of character for what he had been taught to expect from humans. He turned back to examining the surge in power requirements they had experienced since expanding their research fields.\n\nIn due time Third Cousin sent him a terse approval, which he passed on to the Trisk. He didn\u2019t quite forget about the issue, but when the Trisk skittered into his office the next day with a gloomy set to his joints, the base commander didn\u2019t immediately ping why he was back.\n\n\u201cCan I serve you?\u201d the base commander asked.\n\nThe Trisk brushed his eye hairs back and flexed in frustration. \u201cThank you for obtaining the information for me.\u201d\n\nThe base commander remembered to pause for six slow wing beats before responding. \u201cYou are welcome.\u201d\n\nThe Trisk bobbed his body in acknowledgment of the reply but didn\u2019t go. The base commander wondered what the Trisk could want. That he wanted something more was clear.\n\n\u201cDid you answer your question?\u201d the base commander asked.\n\n\u201cNot in the least,\u201d the Trisk said with a glum set to his joints. \u201cI only intensified my questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like to tell me about your questions?\u201d the base commander asked, hoping the Trisk had no such intentions.\n\nHowever the Trisk perked up in relief and began circling slowly as he processed his thoughts. The base commander tried to subtly settle more comfortably on his perch; it was going to be a long explanation.\n\n\u201cI was out scouting outside of the fenced areas for the best places to set the insect traps,\u201d the Trisk said. \u201cI was accompanied by one of the morning shift human crew leads for protection. We had found many good sites but wanted to get some more as there was more time left in the day. I am afraid we went past our working hours for the day, but our scouting was so successful. We were headed back and found a group of the evening shift humans wrapping up their work hours. They had been modulating the energy flow in the fencing and appeared to be gathering up the scattered insulating components.\u201d\n\nThe Trisk paused and gave a sudden shudder, brushing his paws all over his body in a gesture that members of the species usually used to assess their bodies after an injury.\n\n\u201cOne human was holding what I assumed was a cold wire, but as we got closer, I felt on my electro bristles that it was twitching,\u201d the Trisk went on.\n\nThe base commander was trying to keep the Trisk\u2019s colloquialism in mind while the other talked.\n\n\u201cI expressed my concern, but my human escort pointed out that the human could not conduct the charge as his feet were insulated,\u201d the Trisk said. \u201cBut then a second human set down a pad of insulation and grabbed the first human\u2019s hand. Then a third did the same. Then each of the shift placed the insulation down and stepped on it, forming a chain of human hands.\u201d A massive shudder ran through the Trisk\u2019s body as he recalled the next part. \u201cThe final human put down his insulation and took the hand of the human next to him,\u201d the Trisk finally forced himself to go on.\n\nThe base commander found himself oddly fascinated now. Something horrible was clearly coming, and he couldn\u2019t look away.\n\n\u201cThe human who was with me had stopped walking and was watching them with his body poised as if he was expecting entertainment,\u201d the Trisk went on. \u201cThe line of humans was focused on the last human in the line. They were encouraging him to do something. Finally the last human in line took off his foot coverings and stepped off his insulating pad.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then the current would have a circuit and would have\u2014\u201d the base commander couldn\u2019t help interjecting.\n\nThe Trisk stiffened in affront and to the base commander\u2019s shock interrupted him. \u201cIt shocked each human in the line, sending them all flying from the force of the electrocution,\u201d the Trisk clicked out. \u201cMy escort was laughing, and once they recovered from their automatic pain display, the rest of the humans were laughing as well.\u201d  \n\nThe Trisk stopped talking, and the base commander stared at him in mild horror.\n\n\u201cWhat was their average educational level?\u201d the base commander finally asked.\n\n\u201cNot one of them had less than a tertiary degree accredited from the home university,\u201d the Trisk replied.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d the base commander suddenly burst out.\n\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d said the Trisk grimly, \u201cand now I am even without a theory.\u201d\n\n# [Humans are Weird \u2013 Chain Reaction - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/X6PZjaSC5rE)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBook 1 \"[\u200b](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)Humans are Weird: I Have the Data\"\n\n[Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RSVHL81)\n\n[Barnes & Nobe (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/humans-are-weird-adelia-gibadullina/1138927933;jsessionid=CED1CA2DD868CAE60C7F4EAC8FEDD5E5.prodny_store01-atgap01?ean=9781736003923)\n\n[Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=USta%20eBook%20by%20Betty%20Adams%20-%201230004645337%20%7C%20Rakuten%20Kobo%20United%20States)\n\n[Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# [Humans are Weird: We Took A Vote BOOK 2 | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)",
        "The rain was coming down in buckets. The streets were slick and cars were going slow to avoid crashes. The sky was dark and the TV was on, illuminating the faces of a couple, snug in a bundle of blankets. The movie was boring to say the least, but neither wanted to move as they were too comfortable and rarely got to enjoy moments like this. \r\n\n\u201c\u2026But I love you Laura!\u201d Exclaimed the lead actor. He was a stout redhead with barely any facial hair, though it seemed like he really wanted there to be some. \r\n\n\u201cI know you do, but why risk what is for what could be?\u201d Asked Laura. She was the lead actress and was quite famous for her movies. She had bright blonde hair and wonderful green eyes. Her hair was held up in a ponytail, but it was an elegant style that few manage to pull off as well as her. \r\n\n\u201cHow cheesy can these lines be?\u201d The boy asked. \u201cThis has to be some sort of satire right?\u201d\r\n\n\u201cYou wish.\u201d Replied the girl, smug with her quip. \u201cWith how old this movie is, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if people didn\u2019t know what satire was.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cNo way. They\u2019ve got to know what satire is.\u201d \r\n\nThe boy had dark chocolate hair, with caramel brown eyes. He was toned with muscle, not quite ripped with muscle, but far from scrawny. The girl also had brown hair, but it was a lighter color, more like milk chocolate. She also had blond highlights at the tips of her hair that blended seamlessly with the rest of her hair. Her eyes were an green color, though not a murky swamp green, more of a bright, lively green. A green that if you saw, you would be reminded of the grass on the fields, the trees up so high in the air, the vines that grew on the old stone walls, and the moss that grew along the boulders on the mountains. They truly were a beautiful color.\r\n\nThey had been dating for almost a year now, which passed both slowly and quickly. Slowly from all the work the boy had from his job, but quick from the few actual heartfelt moments between the two. Though they didn\u2019t have many tender moments, that didn\u2019t bother them. They enjoyed the fact they were able to have them in the first place, as they had been fighting for the others affection for years. So as they were snuggled together in the blankets, even though they were bored from the movie, they still would consider this night to be a highlight of their first year. \r\n\nThe girl moved away from the guy, which confused him. But his confusion didn\u2019t last long when the girl rotated around to face him. \r\n\n\u201cYou know you\u2019re handsome right?\u201d She asked in a teasing manner.\r\n\n\u201cOf course, how else would I get someone as beautiful as you.\u201d Stated the boy, following in suite with her teasing which caused her to lightly giggle.\r\n\n\u201cI wish we could stay like this forever.\u201d She remarked.\r\n\n\u201cAh, but that would get uncomfortable wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d He replied. \u201cWe\u2019d never be able to eat which I don\u2019t if you know this but I like food quite a bit.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cOh shut up.\u201d She giggled. She leaned for a kiss, and their lips met.\r\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a quick peck, but it also wasn\u2019t a lustful one either. It was one filled with love, but in a romantic and carefree way. There were no strings attached to that kiss. No expectations. Just a a kiss that was sent and received as a \u201cThank you for being you\u201d. She rotated again to continue watching the movie and they both eventually feel asleep in each others arms, content with today\u2019s events.",

Years of those fancy cigars having damaged his throat, and left many stains across the old ceiling and fan blades, and ash marks on his suit showed he'd likely already gone through one or two today alone. His thin brown hair was a bit of a mess, and he lacked his usual tie. \n\nI stared at him as his words slowly sank in. I felt my throat dry, and my fingers began to pick at the edges of my sleeves. \"i'm... What?!\" I said, less a question and more a shocked, angry bark. \n\n\"Look, I didn't make the call! It came from upper management. Said some behavior they saw during inspection was unacceptable..\" he said, voice lowering a little as he said the reason. The shame clear in his dull grey eyes.\n\n\"Behavior?? Oh do you mean my girlfriend bringing me lunch?\" I spat out angrily. My skin began to feel hot, and I would bet my pale complexion was nearly as red as the freckles across my cheeks. My hands balled into fists, knuckles white as I felt a bit of strain on my coveralls, the muscles flexed in rage enough to strain the fabric. They had always been too small. Women's clothes never quite came to my sizes. With my bulkier frame and small chest, they always felt too tight, or too loose on places.\n\n\"Look Car, it's out of my hands now. I'm sorry. You were a good worker for what that's worth to you,\" he spoke in a calmer voice, the edgy exterior he tried to hold softened by the sight of my own anger.\n\nI knew it wasn't his call. He had hired me because I was a big, strong woman, and it helped keep protests away from the factory when an openly gay woman built like a brick shithouse worked for him. Sadly, this is also why I usually had my days off correspond with inspector visits, and investor days. \n\n\"Can't you get me a recommendation then?? I think the steel mills are hiring again!\" I said, trying to convert my growing anger to something productive. It was the only good lesson I took from the \"therapy\" my parents forced me into as a kid, or torture as I had called it. \n\n\"I can try Car, but I can't promise anything,\" he returned solemnly, checking his box of cigars.\n\n\"They blacklisted me..\" I whispered softly. The color draining from my skin.\n\n\"You know I can't say that's true... But I won't deny it neither..\" he sighed, his cigar box empty.\n\nI threw my tag and keycard on his desk, before storming out of the building. A few coworkers glanced at me quietly, but none really spoke up. I bet they warned them against fraternizing on the job from now on. Bastards...\n\nAn hour after collecting my shtuff from the locker and taking public trans to get home, I had made up a plan at least to try and find a good lawyer. It might take years to fight, but it was worth a shot at least. They would want me to just give up, keep everyone quiet and complacent. They hadn't fucked with someone like me before.\n\nTurning the key into my apartment, I was immediately greeted to the smell of my fiance bringing work home. Something between rotten eggs and pig farts, the house stank. It put an odd smile on my face, knowing she at least lived for her work.\n\n\"Babe! I'm home,\" I called out, dropping the crate of items beside the doorway as I took off my boots. A soft shout of Fuck was the answer I got before the door to her work room shook. \"Tell me you didn't break another window just now...\"\n\nPalming the doorknob, I slowly opened her door to find some sort of yellow powder covering the whole room. Powder that smelled like death. In the middle at her table sat my fiance. Her big curly black hair covered now in this thick powder. Her caramel skin now the same. Her goggles slowly came off as she blinked for a moment, those lovely chocolate brown eyes glancing at me as she smiled that big goofy smile. Her warm full cheeks adorable even covered in dust, and she nearly hopped up out of her chair to rush to me. Her large frame now making her look like a goofy Peep with how she moved.\n\n\"Hey! How was work?\" *She hugged me, as always uncaring of her own state as rhe yellow mix smeared into my coveralls. I would of chuckled if the smell wasn't gagging me.\n\n\"Geez babe... What is this shtuff?\" I asked, one hand over my mouth and nose as the other arm hugged her.\n\n\"Oh, I was just trying to work on a new non-lethal deterrent for crops against pests using sulfur and similar chemicals found in stink bugs and skunks, but uh, it kinda went boom..\" she smiled sheepishly.\n\n\"Well, it's definitely an effective deterrent,\" I choked out. If I hadn't been used to working in a chemical factory, I would probably be vomiting by now. \"We should call someone to clean this,\" I added in.\n\n\"Oh I've got it handled,\" as she tapped a little button on her table, as a large series of vacuum holes popped from the other tables, quickly sucking up the powder. The room was mostly tile, glass and non-stick surfaces, so it wasn't hard for the ways stuff to come off. What remained were small clumps in corners. \"i can wipe the rest up after dinner,\" she chimed happily.\n\n\"And after you shower,\" I added.\n\n\"Awwww but but i just showered yesterday,\" she whined.\n\n\"You are covered in skunk powder babe. No more buts,\" I said with a little bit of a stern tone.\n\nShe whined, but didn't offer any more resistance. Marching her to the bathroom, I helped her strip down. Her working clothes had a lot of layered to help keep her safe, including a face mask she would normally wear alongside the goggles. \n\nOnce she was finally under the water, I headed back through our living room towards our bedroom. Just a small couch and a big tv we had saved for, with a few of her consoles underneath in a makeshift entertainment piece I had built for it. I didn't play much, but I loved watching her play. The floor was dark blue carpet, her favorite, while the walls were bright yellow. She said that she painted them that color to remind her of me every day when I was at work. Goofy, cheesy shit like that is what made me love her so much.\n\nSlipping into our bedroom, I dug into her dresser. A pink painted wooden four drawer piece with a mirror on top with a long crack in it. We had done that the first night we stayed here together. Good memories. Quickly getting some underwear, shorts and a loose short for her, I headed back to the shower to place the clothes down for her on top of the toilet, before looking over myself in the mirror. \n\nMessy long blonde locks all tangled and knotted in my ponytail. She'd wanna brush that out before bed. My coveralls half off showing the beater shirt underneath, and the muscular figure I had. I was no olympian, but I was certainly strong. 6 feet tall, with hands callused from moving and working heavy machinery, and muscles to match. Selene always told me I was perfect for a big girl like. I would always laugh. 7 years together, and I couldn't imagine my life without her anymore. \n\nAs the shower stopped, I saw her hand reaching out for a towel, and placed it in her hand. The bad news could wait until tomorrow.",
        "So one time when i was about 5 years old I did something stupid that day that almost got me killed, my mom held my hand as we crossed the street, then in the middle of the street i turned my head back with a truck being very close to hitting my head, her hand let go of mine since i turned back too much, she ended up pulling me near her, of course she was angry but as a stupid todler i wasn't scared for some reason",
        "This is the fourth chapter to my story Must I be the Villainess? You can find the first chapter on r/Abriella_Castoda or u/Abriella_Castoda. \n\nThe morning rays crept into my pink bedroom. *Curse these darned sheer curtains.* I turned over, trying to keep the sun out of my eyes. I just wanted to sleep for a while longer. One of the few good things about being transported here was the fact that I can sleep longer. I opened my eyes reluctantly and saw both Mary and Lily standing off to the side of the bed.\n\n\u201cIs it time already?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, madam. You asked us to wake you as early as possible today but not before the sun comes up.\u201d Lily said to the floor. *Have I mistreated them already? She won\u2019t look me in the eye.* Lily was a nervous type of girl. Dark skin and beautiful dark eyes and curly hair. \n\n\u201cThe sun has been up for an hour. We thought now would be the best time to wake you, madam.\u201d Mary\u2019s confidence was more apparent, kept her head held high, and looked everyone in the eye. Tan skin, long black hair, and green eyes. They both wore their hair in a bun. It\u2019s most likely a standard for the maids.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you. I won\u2019t ask this of you often.\u201d I gave a soft smile, though I felt like just curling up and going back to sleep. There was too much to do to enjoy that luxury, though. First thing\u2019s first, I needed to prepare for the day. \n\nI bathed and brushed my teeth. Thank GOD they knew about this here. I would have died if I couldn\u2019t brush my teeth! Mary combed my hair and I picked a comfortable, yet appropriate, dress for a day around the estate. *Because APPARENTLY, I can\u2019t just wear my nightgown. Even if I don\u2019t leave the room.* Once I completed my routine, I sent for paper and pens. Or quills. Time to get down to business.\n\nObviously, I realized I couldn\u2019t just stay at home all the time. The daughter of a duke has a reputation to uphold. Especially if I wanted to get married and out of this godforsaken plotline. The way I saw it was if I wasn\u2019t single, I had no reason to interfere with the leads. If I was in a relationship, I could have that as an excuse to completely write myself out of the narrative. Mary came in with the paper and pens. \n\n\u201cThank you, Mary. Could you list all the parties for this year? Starting with the most important and please write the dates next to them. Thank you.\u201d I grabbed the other pen and a sheet of paper from her and wrote practice situations for meeting the Prince, and how to best excuse myself. Since I can just avoid the first male lead, I\u2019ll prepare for the Prince. I was submerged in my work when I noticed the room was particularly quiet. *Did they leave?* I glanced over at Mary, and she looked troubled. This was the first time I had seen her behave this way. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d She jumped and stared at me, which is out of character for her based on what I had seen so far.\n\n\u201cYes, madam. Sorry, madam.\u201d She clutched the paper and the pen strangely, and then I realized it. *She can\u2019t read, can she?* \n\n\u201cMary?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes madam?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you read and write?\u201d She shifted from one foot to the other.\n\n\u201cNo madam\u201d\n\n\u201cLily?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes? Madam?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you read and write?\u201d She bobbed her head and looked as if she were debating what to say, glancing at me, then to Mary.\n\n\u201cYes madam,\u201d she said finally\n\n\u201cMary, give the paper to her and come help me with this,\u201d I said nonchalantly. They just stared at me, dazed. I didn\u2019t give it a second thought and continued. They looked at each other and back at me, swapped papers, and Lily rushed off. I\u2019m sure they expected me to be upset and cause a fuss over this. \u201cMary, how long have you been a maid?\u201d She looked at me with fear in her eyes, trembling, she stuttered. It was evident that she was trying to find a good way to word her reply. The poor girl feared her job was at stake, or maybe even her life. \u201cI am preparing for future parties, and I would like to know safe topics to discuss. As you know, I\u2019ve never been good at that.\u201d Mary relaxed and nodded her head.\n\nSurprisingly, Mary had worked with her mother as a maid since she was nine. She was twenty-four then. That was fifteen whole years! Lily had only just started two years ago, and she was 19. I couldn\u2019t get Lily to look me in the eye until I asked her about family. She had three little siblings, a boy, and two girls. Lily is just a very shy young girl, though she was definitely sweet. She even offered to teach Mary to read and write. \n\nOnce we started discussing the latest gossip, we discarded our work. We grabbed tea and cake and huddled on the couch together. I listened to all the latest gossip about the nobles and even some Lily requested, and when I worked up the nerve, Doctor Pruitt became the next inquiry.\n\n\u201cMary, what\u2019s the latest news about Doctor Pruitt?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know? That is one of the few people I can\u2019t get much information on? I got that he moved here from Sarrenburg. He settled in fast and he now has a practice. A noble hasn\u2019t snatched him up as a family doctor for some odd reason. I was quite surprised that your father didn\u2019t hire him. He recently moved, so there is no telling where he has been!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the master didn\u2019t hire him because he was so friendly with the lady,\u201d Lily whispered, probably to herself but loud enough to be overheard. \u201cI\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t come yet today. It is almost three in the afternoon!\u201d This part she said louder, she looked over at me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come soon. He said he\u2019d check on me a few more times before clearing me.\u201d I nodded.\n\nWe sat in silence for a while. None of us knew what to say after that. *What an awkward silence. I don\u2019t want to sit here anymore. Will it be too strange to just leave? Should I say something?* I tried to read a book I had grabbed, but I had made little progress. The silence was getting deafeningly loud and I glanced at Mary a few times impatiently. As if she senses my shift in mood, she stood, stretched, and gathered her materials. I used this opportunity to escape. \n\n\u201cI am going to take a walk and won\u2019t be back for a while. I don\u2019t want to be bothered, so please find something to do for a while.\u201d Before they could protest, I scurried out of the room.\n\nI made my way to the garden fairly easily. Snagging a book from the library on the way here. I hadn\u2019t been able to walk in the garden since I had been thrown into this book. It looked exactly like a typical noble garden, one you would see in the movies. It\u2019s definitely pretty, and it smelled nice, but they looked similar. I spotted a nice secluded spot and sat in the grass to read. *Should I really be reading when what got me into this whole mess?* I contemplated for a moment. *Meh. I\u2019m bored. Might as well.* I opened the book and dove into the pages. \n\nI suppose I ended up falling asleep at some point because when I woke up I had the book resting on my chest, a few locks of hair in my face, and boots beside me. *Wait, what? Boots?* I looked back again. *Yup, someone is standing here.* My eyes trailed along the hem of his pants, to the edge of his shirt, then up to his face. *Oh god, not again!* Our first male lead, Isha, glared down at me.\n\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I asked in a sickeningly sweet voice. He showed another look of disgust. *Are you ever going to talk man?* I rolled my eyes, stood, and brushed off my dress. \u201cIt was a pleasure as always.\u201d I spat out, oozing with sarcasm.\n\n\u201cWhy were you here?\u201d His tone was curt and somewhat demanding. It surprised me he spoke at all. I turned to face him.\n\n\u201cNot that I have to answer you, but it was a beautiful day. I had an interesting book. And I had time to kill waiting for Doctor Pruitt. Not to mention this IS also MY house.\u201d He scowled at my answer. I turned to leave again. \n\n\u201cSure, seems like you had an interesting book. So interesting you couldn\u2019t keep your eyes open,\u201d he mumbled under his breath. Without turning back, I scoffed haughtily. *You\u2019re really asking for trouble here!*\n\n\u201cYes! It was a lovely book. I might ask, though, what were you doing here during work hours? Are you so bored you couldn\u2019t help pick a fight with a young lady relaxing?\u201d Without waiting for his reply or even looking back, I walked back towards the house. I\u2019ll have to be more careful next time. Upon my return, I found Doctor Pruitt waiting for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIT'S POSTING DAY! :D Someone brought it to my attention that my verb tenses were lacking. It was a much appreciated piece of advice! I put it through three grammar-checking programs and watched a bunch of videos, so hopefully, it's a little better! I will eventually fix the first three chapters as well. Let me know if you see anything else wrong because I'm still learning. Thanks again for all your support! The next chapter comes out on Sunday the 24th. Until next time!",
        "So i was at a resort once for vacation and while at the water area decided to try waterboarding. They had that thing that shoots high pressure water to simulate a wave and i used that. He told me to slide in at an angle and I wiped out immediately. On my second try I thought i had it. The water pressure though was app too high for me and blasted my swim trunks halfway down. There were like 6 kids and some dudes who got to see my ass and balls because I don\u2019t know how to pick the right size of clothes",
        "So when I was let just say 7 years old. I had a nightmare about how I was left at the train station I somehow still remeber this nightmare still after almost 8 years. So as I was saying. I once went with my mother to the train station to catch the train going to a small city like 10 kilometers from where I lived. So I went on the train. Once we arrived there we left the train. It was pretty confusing the station. What I remeber from my Nightmare was that once I got out of the train it was full of people as it was rush hour. I just remembered how my mom disappeared in the crowd and I was just standing in the middle of the platform surrounded by many people. I didnt know where to go so I kinda just followed some random people to the exit. I didnt know when you get out of the station that there were train crossing so I saw the lights blink and all but as smart I was a 7 year old I almost crossed the crossing before someone grabbed me to prevent me being hit by the train. I looked behind me and it was my mother. Then I suddenly woke up from my nightmare. I was so relieved that it was just a nightmare.. so yeah that's kinda my nightmare that I somehow remembered after 8 years. Maybe I was traumatized but I'm not sure.",

        "\n\n\n\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/q49cs1/if_you_ever_see_someone_standing_outside_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nAs I continued to drive to the next cabin, I did my best to jog my memory to see if there were any behavioral clues that I missed regarding my father.\nI was drawing a blank, so I\u2019m wondering if I was so used to living around pure insanity, which would explain the reason why I couldn\u2019t think of abnormal behaviors my father exhibited.\n\nHe was never violent against my mother or my siblings and the only odd behavior, that I can think of was when we came back from Alaska in the 1980\u2019s, which was when he became really emotionally withdrawn, almost like he lost his purpose in life.\n\nBut being emotionally withdrawn is not necessarily a personality trait to correlate harm against others, unless he was feeling remorseful for what he did? I ponder to myself.\n\nI get to the next cabin, which I remember was the woman, who told my father that she was from \u201cTennessee\u201d.\n\nMuch like the \u201cOklahoma\u201d cabin, the property of this cabin is also overgrown with weeds and has a thick layer of moss on the cabin\u2019s rooftop, that was caused from the shade of the birch trees.\n\nI get out of my car and head for the cabin\u2019s door.\n\nThe cabins are all similarly built, with them all having a single door and a window on their left side.\n\nI brace myself as I knock on the door, because I don\u2019t know if the woman from \u201cTennessee\u201d will answer or some other shadowy figure from my past.\n\nI jog my memory to think, if I caused any type of physical or emotional harm to anyone else besides Azul, but I\u2019m not coming up with anyone else.\n\nSure I teased people throughout my life, but I wouldn\u2019t constitute that as harm.\n\nI continue to knock on the door and no one answers, so I back up a few steps from the door to see if this will encourage someone to come out.\n\nI wait a few moments and still no one comes outside.\n\nSo I walk to the side of the cabin, where the window is located.\n\nThere\u2019s a layer of fog on the window that I wipe off with my shirt. As I wipe away the moisture, the inside of the cabin is starting to become more visible.\n\nI have to squint my eyes to make sense of what\u2019s going on inside the cabin, because the room I\u2019m seeing looks more like someone\u2019s living room than a rustic cabin.\n\nI see an old fashioned television that is big and wide, along with couches and orange shag carpeting.\n\nI\u2019m more convinced now that this cabin\u2019s window is a porthole into a different room, from decades in the past and not the actual cabin itself.\n\nMy mind tries to make sense of what it is looking out, when two people enter the room.\n\nI was expecting to see my father, but instead I see two females.\n\nThe one female looks vaguely familiar, where I suspect she is the woman from \u201cTennessee\u201d.\n\nThe other woman looks much more familiar, where I have to squint my eyes again to make sure that I\u2019m actually seeing my own mother and that mind isn\u2019t playing tricks on me.\n\n\u201cHah!\u201d I say out loud, as I try to think of a scenario, why I would see an image of my mother.\n\nI continue to look through the window and I see the two of them drinking wine, while sitting on the couch doing nothing more than just talking.\n\nThough this is really bizarre being able to look into the past, however nothing out of the ordinary is happening, while the two lady\u2019s just sit and  talk to each other.\n\nThen, when the two of them get halfway through their glasses of wine, the woman from \u201cTennessee\u201d looks like she is becoming really tipsy, where it looks like she is about to pass out at any moment.\n\nAs suspected, within a minutes time, the woman from \n\u201cTennessee\u201d completely passes out.\n\nMy mother being fully awake does something shocking and unsuspecting, where she leaves the room and comes back with tape and rope in her hands.\n\nI look on with horror, as my mother binds and gags this defenseless woman on the floor of the living room.\n\nMy eyes can\u2019t believe what their seeing, as I never suspected that my mother could do anything like this.  I guess my mind had stereotyped a male to be the culprit of crimes like these, so I never thought my mother as being a suspect.\n\nI slowly walk away from the window feeling empty and hollow inside.  \n\nI\u2019m now guessing that perhaps these cabins and the people, who reside in them, were a wake up call to my dad to keep an eye on my mother to stop her rein of terror back in the 1980\u2019s.\n\nWhat do I do now?  Do I go to the police? I keep asking myself.\n\nThis will be the hardest decision that I\u2019ll ever have to make because my kids really adore my mother and she\u2019ll be sent to prison forever if I open my mouth.\n\nI decide to head to the airport as I didn\u2019t feel it necessary to stop at any further cabins.\n\nI missed my original flight with my wife and kids, so I told the airlines some sob story and they booked me on a later flight.\n\nAll I thought about was my mother, on the flight home, and how I should proceed now that I know what she did to those people in the cabins.  My mother has been on Haldol and Lithium, ever since I could remember, which probably has been keeping her violent behaviors in check, with also the help of my father as well.\n\nIn a way, her medications have made her a different person, however she still committed those crimes and she should have to pay.\n\nReluctantly, I make my mind up and figure the best thing for me to do is go to my parents crawl space and get the drivers licenses and other keep sakes, that my mother kept of the people she victimized.\n\nIt\u2019s now past midnight and my parents are long past asleep, so I don\u2019t bother waking them up, as I go straight to the crawl space.\n\nI use my phone\u2019s flashlight to navigate on my hands and knees in the dark and I eventually make my way to the chest.\n\nMiraculously, all the drivers licenses and other mementos are still there, where I grab as much as I could.\n\nWith the evidence literally in my hands, I crawl out of the dark, damp crawl space.  I contemplate whether its better to show my wife the evidence first or go to directly to the police station.\n\nI crawl my way out where I start to see the moonlight.  In addition, to the moonlight, I see a figure standing in the driveway, who is undeniably my mother, who is holding my father\u2019s shot gun, he used to shoot clay pigeons.\n\n\u201cOh jeez, you scared me mom!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just let bygones be bygones?\u201d She responds to me in a cold distant manner.\n\n\u201cMom, there are tortured soles stuck in those cabins in Alaska! They\u2019re stuck in limbo because of your actions!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you had stayed away from Alaska, then you wouldn\u2019t be having these thoughts right now!\u201d\n\n\u201cFor many years, I had horrible nightmares and thoughts from when we visited Alaska back in the 1980\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegardless, you should have stayed away from Alaska!\u201d My mother says to me as she points the shotgun at me.\n\n\u201cHow many people have you harmed?\u201d I ask her, while she continues to point the shotgun at me.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another chest in the attic filled with twice as much stuff than what you have in your hands!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d I say, while I stand there in complete shock in the driveway.\n\nThen time stands still, as I hear a loud bang and I see a bright flash.\n\nI wake up sitting in a chair. \u201cWow, that was the worst dream I ever had.\u201d As I slowly shake my head back and forth in disbelief and to help myself wake up.\n\nI look around this unfamiliar room and I have no idea where I am.  Thinking I\u2019m in a hotel room in Alaska, I walk towards the door and open it.\n\nA gust of cool wind hits my face as I open the door.  I squint my eyes in disbelief, as I see a lawn filled with overgrown weeds and a road that undeniably looks like Route 3 in Alaska.",
        "This will be a long one, but the ending is actually insane. \n\nIn my senior year of high school, one of my mutual friends introduced me to a guy 3 years older than me. We got along quite well, and eventually started dating. Since he was a couple years older, he told me he was in college. He had a nice little sports car and took me all around town, and always insisted on paying. We'd go to the amusement park, hibachi restaurants, karaoke, we ate out about 3-4 times a week, and he'd never let me pay. \n\nSummer came and went and soon, I started school at my college. After I realized how expensive school, books, rent, food and life in general was, I started to question where he got his money. I guess I was a naive high school kid who didn't understand how expensive life was. He told me he was in a \"co-op\" internship program at his prestigious school, and got a very high paying finance job, and they pay him very well. The school he told me he went to was about an hour away from mine, and he would often visit me. One day, I had a bad period cramp and headache from the cramping, and he drove to me to bring me lunch, Tylenol and keep me company. \n\nHe told me he had plans to go to another city, I knew his ex was going to be there but he assured me that it was some other huge event where tons of mutual friends were all going. We had planned a double date with his best friend and his best friend's girlfriend the day after he got back. He gets back from his trip and his attitude towards me completely changes. He wasn't a nice, gentlemanly and loving guy any longer. For example on the double date, I went to the bathroom and he was deep in conversation with his best friend, but as soon as he sees me,he mouths \"I'll tell you later\" as I'm walking towards the table. On the date, it was the first time I'm meeting this friend so I'm trying to not make it awkward. His friend keeps bragging about how he lifts at the gym over dinner, so in a joking tone, I turn to the girl and say \"wow, lucky you\". At that comment, my then boyfriend lost it. He started telling me that I'm ungrateful and I should be lucky that he's dating me, not his friend's girlfriend. I started explaining how I was just joking but he cut me off mid-sentence and told me to \"just shut up\". He was my ride home so I just held back my tears and bit my tongue. I couldn't believe that this guy who would drive over an hour  to see me just a week ago would humiliate me and snap at me like that. Again, I was young, stupid naive so I didn't address it on the way home, thinking that maybe he had a bad time in the other city or a bad day. \n\nA week passes and he texts me, \"my friend is in a situation and needs some advice. He is dating a girl locally, but he's also in love with a girl from another city, what should he do?\" I remember this so vividly because I was sitting on a bus, on my way home from class and was trying to hold back my tears until I got home. But I just responded \"just go date Kathy (not her real name)\". He had the audacity to ask me \"how did you know I was talking about me?\" Anyway we finally broke up but he decided to drive to me that night for one final talk (and for me to give him his things back, whatever I had in my apartment of his). He admitted to cheating on me when he went to his ex's city, and I had figured, out of pettiness and because my feelings were hurt, I flung a piece of receipt paper at him when we were done our talk at the restaurant. HE was so mad at ME for \"disrespecting him\" because I flung a piece of paper at him, he scolded me and yelled at me and told me to NEVER disrespect him again. \n\nThat's the normal part of the story, here is where it gets wild. A week after all of this goes down, his best friend from the double date messages me on Facebook and asks me how I'm doing. I honestly replied that I wasn't very good. He then told me that my ex wasn't the person he told me he was. Apparently his grades were so bad in high school that he had to drop out, so he forged a fake acceptance letter and mailed it to himself. His parents were so impressed that their pathetic son made it into college, that they bought him a car. They also wire about $20,000 to him every year for classes, and \"rent\", and that is where he gets his money, in his free time, he works a part time job as a security guard for more $.\n\nI asked his friend why he was telling me this and he said 2 reasons. Firstly, when he met me on the double date, he said I seemed nice and didn't deserve to be lied to. Secondly, because his friend's parents let my ex live with them and have been noticing that whatever cash they leave around on the kitchen counter, loose coins and couple of small bills, would keep going missing. They all knew it was him, so they are planning to kick him out soon.\n\nI confronted him. He told me to not tell his friends (he had lied to all his friends to keep up the facade) because if they heard it from anyone besides him, they wouldn't ever want to be his friend again. He said the apology and explanation should come from him. So the next day, he posts a long ass post (almost as long as this one) on his Facebook wall. My best friend comes over and we realize he made the post private ONLY TO ME. I just blocked him and moved on with my life. Thankfully we broke up in a few months, him cheating on me was a huge bullet dodged.",
        "I want to apologize in advance for my English.  I need to share it with someone.\n\n  I really don't know how to write this story.  It's been more than two weeks ago that a person died in front of our school.  They were only 16 years old in high school.  They were crossing the road (not to a pedestrian crossing, it is like a shortcut) to get to the tram when a car crashed into them.  This person died on the spot.  Our school talked about it and warned us to be more careful.  My classmate and I speculated about it, we asked ourselves, why didn't they look around first?  How could this have happened in the first place?  Didn't they see the oncoming car?\n\n  Today I was with several classmates waiting to cross the road, I looked around about 5 times.  Then I walked down the road.  I was in the middle and suddenly the car, a white car, was like five inches in front of me.  WTF.  I swear I didn't see it.  My classmates were like, \u201cWhat are you doing?  What the fuck?  Do you want another monument here?\u201d I just stare and I didn't realize what the fuck just happened.  I still don't know why I stopped at all, as I said, I didn't see the car coming.  I was in the same place when the person died a weeks ago.\n\n  I'm thinking of something my mother said a month ago.  She was with her boyfriend, they were driving to the holiday house.  They stopped at an intersection. And my mom looked if it was clear on the right.  She didn't see any cars, so she said, \"You can go now, right is clear.\"  Her boyfriend also looked and said, \"Are you serious ?!\"  A white car just passed them on the right. My mum was confused because she really didnt see the car comming.\n\n  Thank you for reading.  What do you think about this?",
        "My dog barked at the door, I sprinted towards the leash and went outside, and took him outside, all of a sudden, he ran away and went to the street, i was confused why because there was no one there, the first i saw was my dog turning back, then he looked up, I looked up only to see me about to die, with about 5 airplanes flying down towards me",
        "So this happened to me a few days ago during my drama class.\n\nThe teacher asked the class:\n\"What did you love the most during this class?\"\n\nAnd one of the guys said:\n\"Michael\", which was the name of his friend sitting next to him. Right afterwards when it was Michael's turn to answer, he put a hand on the other guys shoulder, and said:\n\"I love you too, bro\"\n\nIt was quite funny and a little wholesome too :)\n\n(his real name isn't Michael btw, also the grammar might be a little awkward from me translating it)",
        "Hey guys!  I want to go into concept art drawing and Iv been working on some technical skills lately but id like to do some projects pretty soon, more relevant to concept art.  \n\nId love some prompts to get started with.  If anyone has any creative writing projects theyd like to use for a prompt or just some basic ideas, Im open to those!  I enjoy collaborating! I would highly prefer fantasy/ magical realism, and surrealism.",
        "I was on my way to school when a van pulled out in front of me causing me to slam on the brakes. Suddenly three people come out of the van and run towards my car. I put my car in reverse and stepped on the gas. It was too late. They broke open my driver's side window and picked me up out of the car. One guy holding onto my torso and a girl on my feet. I screamed and kicked but nothing seemed to work. The third guy opened the backseat of the van and they hauled me in. They put handcuffs on me and buckled me in the middle seat so I could see them driving. They got back in the van, two in the front and one in the back. \nI still had my phone on me. They told me if I called the cops they\u2019d shoot me. So I videotape my handcuffs and the car then post it on my snapchat story. I then turn off ghost mode so everyone can see my location. Everyone on snapchat started messaging me and most people thought it was a joke. We kept on driving towards some huge rocky mountains near a big beach. One stranger messages me and says he\u2019s at the same beach I\u2019m at. I tell him to come get me and he says no problem. The car stopped then we got out and started walking towards the beach. They\u2019re keeping close to me so no one notices I\u2019m in handcuffs. \nAll of a sudden police showed up. \u201cPUT YOUR HANDS UP\u201d they yelled. The three kidnappers then pull out guns. The police start to shoot and so do they. I run away from them and see the stranger from snapchat calling out to me. I started running towards him when suddenly a bomb dropped. He and several other people get blown into pieces. Blood and guts splattered everywhere. I ran along the shore line hoping I wouldn't get hit by the bombs. Boom boom one after another. I looked over and saw more blood and guts scattered along the beach. People were screaming and running around. Suddenly I tripped and fell. One stranger helped me up and uncuffed me from the handcuffs. \nHe told me to come with him and I was desperate so I did. We drove and drove until we reached a city. I told him thank you and that I can make it from here. He let me out and I waved goodbye, thanking him for saving me. I then walked along the sidewalk and saw a TV with \u2018Breaking News\u2019 on it. I listened to the TV and it mentioned all the names of people who were kidnapped, my name included. Apparently there were a bunch of kidnappers. They said if our names were listed we had to be careful because they were out searching for us. That\u2019s when I finally woke up. My body felt numb and tingly. I was sweating profusely. I\u2019m just happy it\u2019s all over.",
        "It was cold outside and she went for another drink, under the pretense that it would keep her warm but she wasn\u2019t fooling anyone. She had a problem with alcohol. It used to be top shelf but now it\u2019s the cheap stuff.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter though. She just needed enough that she could lie down on the couch and feel the buzz in her head. It was cold in the house, so cold. The power was out, it was a winter storm. The first in a century they said. She should have prepared, but instead she looked in the liquor cabinet, silently sighed, and carried on.\n\nShe had researched means of suicide many times, and found that going out into the freezing snow and drinking oneself to death was one of the most pleasant ways to die. But that wasn\u2019t her intention tonight, not in the house. It wouldn\u2019t get cold enough. But she could push it, yes. She could push it as far as it could go.\n\nThe buzz, the hum, the slow dancing of the lights ahead. This is what she lived for. She was pathetic, and she knew it, and she didn\u2019t mind a bit.\n\nShe focused in on the light, the in and out, the flickering\u2026the energy it put out. Hyper focused now, she could only see the light, the rest of it faded it into the background. She tried to bust it, to break the light, shatter the pieces and let them fall upon her still body.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nShe rubbed her eyes and tried again.\n\nShe focused on the light. In and out, growing clearer and stronger. There was a force here, of that she was sure. This was how it always happened. This is what her grandmother meant when she said it came from the light.\n\nThe strand buzzed harder, and hotter too. Now she was starting to sweat, her brain too puzzled to get up.\n\nShe looked again at it, focused on it, everything. Her pathetic life, her failed relationships, her broken family. She put it all into the light. It burned bright, exceptionally so. So much so that she wanted to cover her eyes and break the spell. But she didn\u2019t.\n\nShe put more and more energy into it. She channeled the alcohol pulsing through her veins into the light. She put the pain and the sadness and the loss into it.\n\nIt blew out in a ferocious shatter. Glass went everywhere. Then darkness.\n\nShe set up suddenly, mechanically brushed the broken glass away from her. She picked up the empty glass on the table next to her and held it out, eyes closed tight. She waited for it to shatter.\n\nShatter, it did. She knew. She cried out, she raged, she screamed. She felt overburdened by the energy that had overtaken her. The strong, pulsing, buzzing energy. Her thoughts were blurred. It was pure destruction.\n\nHer face twisted into a contorted smile. She bent low and picked up yet another piece of the shattered glass. She crushed it in her hand, the blood felt nice. It added to it, really. It was the most important part of it all, really.\n\nWhispers in her head. Too quick and vile to decipher. Not her own voice, it never was. Her energy was surging.\n\nShe gathered the pieces of the broken glass in a frantic yet swift motion. She rushed outside into the freezing snow. The perfect snow. White and glistening, undisturbed. She cut herself with the shards. The voices whispered to her, telling her where to cut and how deep. She cried out, but not in agony. Rather, in ecstasy.\n\nHer blood would power the snow.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that she woke up stunned and freezing cold, with a troupe of concerned neighbors around. They felt pity for her. They thought she was crazy.\n\nBut it was growing and she knew what it meant. She was born for this.\n\nHer blood would revive it and it would be the neighbors bleeding out, crying for their savior. She grew stronger every time.\n\nShe smiled, sickly. She couldn\u2019t wait.",
        "I was sitting down and thinking about something I\u2019ve done that made me think if one would say this is odd or pathological.\n\nWhen I was 7 years old, I hated school and still do. So one day when I was going to school I prayed for a miracle to happen so I wouldn\u2019t have to go to school, I did this every day I know my hatred for school was deep. So roughly around the time the bell was about to ring I was playing chase with my friend, he was chasing me with a ballon. Anyways I tripped and fell on this drain. It was big with little rectangle sections. The teacher on duty swarmed about me and ask if I\u2019m ok because it looked like I had a nasty fall and instead of getting up and saying I\u2019m fine like a normal kid I thought \u201c hey this might get me out of school, maybe for thirty minutes or an hour\u201d mind you I was a 7-year-old. \n\nAnyways I faked my fall further and said my hand felt numb and I couldn\u2019t move it ( all lies ). My teacher sent me to sickbay or others would call the nurse office and I stayed there till around 10 am. Now I was like hey I\u2019ve done this done my time and it\u2019s time to go so I was about to tell the nurse I was feeling better because I was all along when she said: \u201c your temperatures quite high\u201d. After all, she came in there to check my temperature again and I thought \u201c hmm, I\u2019ve come so far why to stop now\u201d not my exact thoughts but similar. So I prolonged my tangled lie once and again and I don\u2019t know-how or the facial expression I had but the nurse looked worried and said I needed to lay down, I looked pale. I never knew what that mean since I was African and I thought looking pale was only for pale-coloured people but I put on such a great act and facial expression that pale meant I looked sick but the sickest thing was that was what was going for.\n\nAnyways the hours go by and I don\u2019t why but I thought that they had cameras in the sickbay so I didn\u2019t eat my lunch for some reason I thought if they saw me eat they\u2019ll think I\u2019m all didn\u2019t and my cover will be a blow and so I don\u2019t. Remember this was all because I hate school.\nI think the nurse got worried and I got bored so she called the principal, she took a look at me and asked if I was ok and I was like yeah my arm is a little sore and I can\u2019t move it ( all lies)\nThen the action kicks in. She called the ambulance, now I\u2019m a bit panicked but also quite proud of myself because I was such a good actress that they actually called the ambulance.\n\nNow I could\u2019ve just come clean and said this was all a misunderstanding and I was all along fine but again in my mind I was like \u201c they\u2019ve come so far and I don\u2019t want to waste the time so why don\u2019t I just act like I\u2019m in pain again\u201d I know this is bad. So we\u2019re in the ambulance car and she\u2019s checking my polls checking my arm and I make sure that any time she touches it I act like I\u2019m in pain like any ounce that she touches my hand I act like I\u2019m in pain because I thought in my head she can\u2019t know that I\u2019m lying she can\u2019t see what I\u2019m feeling so how would she know that I\u2019m faking this pain again I was seven years old. \n\nThis is how I always thought because for some reason I just loved acting like I\u2019m in pain or just giving people completely different answers like whenever we were in the doctor's office  I would say the complete opposite of what they expected. I don\u2019t know why but for some reason I wanted them to diagnose me with some problem I don\u2019t know why I thought like this I think I need therapy but I\u2019m not sure.\n\nAnyways we get to the hospital I put on my mask for the doctor. I\u2019m not sure what I said or did but he looked worried. My mum eventually makes it to the hospital she of course has a worried look on her face as well because though I was badly hurt. \nThe doctor was so worried that he asked my mum if we could do a brain scan on me and check for an unknown tumour. I don\u2019t know what that was I didn\u2019t care I was like oh that\u2019s fun I would love to get my brain scanned. \n\nI\u2019m almost I can I have a talk with my daughter and this was the same hospital that my auntie works at so now that we are in privacy in the hospital bed. I dropped my mask now this is where my seven-year-old brain plays up I start laughing and my mum is so confused she\u2019s like \u201cwhat it what are you doing like what is going on\u201d this is where you know I was a child because I wanted to tell them about my adventure I wanted to tell them about what I did because I was proud of it I was proud to have fooled people into actually thinking I was sick. \n\nSo my auntie knows exactly what to say to get me scared so she was saying like the brain scan is gonna detect my life and is gonna know in everyone\u2019s gonna know that I was lying and of course I was scared I was seven years old I was gullible and I was like no I\u2019ve come so far I don\u2019t wanna get caught blah blah blah anyways the doctor comes back in and he was like what\u2019s your like decision and I was like no I\u2019m fine no I\u2019m good I don\u2019t wanna do it any more you know I\u2019m good he\u2019s like are you sure like I really think it\u2019s a good idea and I was like no you know what I\u2019m fine and my mum was telling him I was fine and ever I sure as suck yeah I\u2019m fine anyways in my little smile smiling and everything as I normally do.\n\nSo the doctor dismisses us and my auntie goes back to work so me and my mum was on our way back home.  My mum was an angry she was more in disbelief and shock because she was just thinking how can I daughter do that she was just saying to me like how could you have done this like how did you pull this off and me with all my glory with all my pride I was like I don\u2019t know I didn\u2019t think I was that convincing but apparently I was she\u2019s too shocked to be angry so she just sort of lectures me I was like please don\u2019t do this again you know you could really get yourself in trouble and I was like yeah I\u2019ve had my fun and I did.\n\nIn conclusion I lied till I was bored and satisfied and scared please tell me if this is a form of a pathological liar or not I\u2019m not too sure but I feel like it\u2019s in the right category.\n\n(Please excuse my poor grammar, I didn\u2019t Proof read this)",

Or it might be three held in a twine for transport. I am not sure.\u201d\n\nSome dim memory of a conversation with one of his ranger friends bubbled up in Twistunder\u2019s awareness. \u201cAnd where on her body is this extra appendage?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt comes off the back of her\u2026\u201d Flipsalong paused and trembled as she visibly tried to think of the term. \u201cYou know, the primary sensory end. With the organs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Twistunder nodded as it started to loosen in his thoughts. \u201cOff the back of her head. And is the detached end constrained by a cloth band?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Flipsalong declared. \u201cDo you know what the appendage is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not sure it is an appendage exactly,\u201d Twistunder said slowly.  \n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Flipsalong drooped in disappointment. \u201cJust an ornamental attachment then?\u201d  \n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Twistunder said. \u201cYou probe\u2026 you have only touched rangers and university professors yet, I assume?\u201d  \n\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Flipsalong said. \u201cHow does that connect?\u201d\n\n\u201cRangers,\u201d Twistunder said, \u201cfollow a strict policy of grooming. As do most researchers who expect to be in an environmental suit. They keep their mammalian fur at a regulation length that will not interfere with the fit of an air tight helmet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is well known,\u201d Flipsalong agreed, \u201cbut how does it connect?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuman fur has no standard growth length,\u201d Twistunder explained. \u201cIt continues to lengthen until it reaches each individual\u2019s genetic maximum. That is why humans are so strict about their length regulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait?\u201d Flipsalong raised a gripping appendage in shock. \u201cYou mean that massive appendage is just a compressed mass of sensory tendrils?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t painful\u2026 I assure you,\u201d Twistunder said, reading the horror in the set of her appendages. \u201cHuman fur has no live nerves once past the membrane.\u201d  \n\n\u201cSo it serves no sensory purpose?\u201d Flipsalong asked.  \n\n\u201cA very limited one at best.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it offer greater radiation or thermal regulation than the standard ranger length?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not believe so,\u201d Twistunder replied.  \n\nFlipsalong curled into what the humans called a thinking loaf and pondered this. \u201cThen why would a human maintain such a mass of useless tendrils?\u201d  Flipsalong demanded.  \n\n\u201cPerhaps we should ask the ambassador,\u201d Twistunder offered. \u201cThough you might want to rephrase that question in the interest of diplomacy.\u201d\n\n# [Humans are Weird \u2013 Braid - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/sDdcQJ1pcqs)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBook 1 \"[\u200b](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)Humans are Weird: I Have the Data\"\n\n[Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RSVHL81)\n\n[Barnes & Nobe (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/humans-are-weird-adelia-gibadullina/1138927933;jsessionid=CED1CA2DD868CAE60C7F4EAC8FEDD5E5.prodny_store01-atgap01?ean=9781736003923)\n\n[Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=USta%20eBook%20by%20Betty%20Adams%20-%201230004645337%20%7C%20Rakuten%20Kobo%20United%20States)\n\n[Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# [Humans are Weird: We Took A Vote BOOK 2 | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)",
        "         My one friend that I\u2019ve known for a while has bullet holes in his arm. It took a while of us working together before I felt comfortable enough asking him what happened. I kind of had a vague idea from what other people told me but hearing his story first hand was eye opening and sad at the same time. Thought some of you would like to hear it.\n\n         Let\u2019s call this guy Sam for privacy reasons. Back in 2016 Sam went back to Africa to visit his family. He was born there and came to America at the age of 20 seeking out a better life but often goes back to Africa to see his family. Sam spent some of his time back there with family and enjoying his time seeing friends. Sam, his sisters, his nephew, and 10 other people took a bus ride to a few towns over. Most of those people on that bus didn\u2019t know it\u2019d be their last moments on Earth.\n\n        Well, it was a normal bus ride. They were traveling, talking, enjoying the scenery. All of the sudden their bus driver says I think these people at this road block are going to rob us as they were holding guns. He made the decision to speed by them without stopping. About a quarter mile up the road they had to stop because the bus ran a flat. Sam got off the bus and was talking with the bus driver and heard metal being hit and than another tire went flat. \n\n         He looked back at the car and flashes were coming from it and then more metal being hit and everyone got back on the bus as the car was getting closer. He told me all of the sudden he felt his arm getting very heavy as he was looking around while sitting down. All he started to see was red. The car got closer and he pretended to be dead while he felt a water like substance just running down his arm all over his leg. He couldn\u2019t feel any pain even though he had just been shot by a high powered machine gun.\n\n         The car ended up driving away and the aftermath left him feeling sick to his stomach. Almost everyone on the bus was dead except his nephew, and one of his sisters. This included a mother and her baby. They had to wait 12 hours inside the bus for another one to come by. He saw many people die that day including 2 of his sisters. My company heard the story and paid for all of his medical bills. Meeting this guy, you would never know the things he went through because of how kind of a person he is and how he looks at life. This is some of his story, had to leave a lot of details out, thought some people would want to hear.",
        "I meet with lots of bad persons in my life .. at school etc.. then i meet with their good look alikes at another time and place .. sure they are different people with different names and even different genders but i really feel that they are like the good twins of those evil twins.. sure my brain is connecting both of them because their faces look alike each other but i have a feeling ..you know.. and sometimes vice versa.. i Wonder anybody also experienced this situation.. and one more thing.. when i have positive or negatife connection with a person, then soon i see his/her look alike in a \"new\" tv commercial..or in a movie.. tv series.. really weird",
        "February 11, 2020 ~ 16:20.  I\u2019m leaving school, there was a girl I liked behind me.  I listened music.  At that moment I was listening to something like \"Close Eyes DVRST\", it was very beautiful, but it hurt for me.  The music began, then I heard the clap of a sniper rifle, then the darkness (beat 0:17) became dark for a while, and then it became brighter.  And I ended up in a white room, I could control my body, but then I saw the memories of how this girl shot me.  To be honest, I don\u2019t know how else I remember it, but in principle, no one will remember.  When I had a flashback, I was under anesthesia at that moment.  When I woke up, I thought that I was in a dream, but it turned out that I survived.  After 2 days, the FSB (Federal Security Service of Russia) comes to me and asks all sorts of questions, I will not talk about them here, you understand, BUT.  The FSB wanted to close up the plan.  They made me dead according to documents and took me to another country (Japan) And with this they found the shooter ... It turned out to be my neighbor ... But there were problems.  I was declared dead for this made a fake funeral.  Everyone had already said goodbye to me, but then I showed up and wrote to my friend and that girl ... My friend did not believe when I was writing until the moment when I called him.  And the girl at that time was also in Japan.  Therefore, she did not see the message because of the SIM card.  Fortunately, I found her in the city.  And she (littered for mat) ahuela.  Well, now she is my girlfriend)))) (ask questions if you want.) (Oh yes, English is not my native language, but damn Russian ...)",
        "  \n\nThe Altar \n\n Ohio Museum Complex on the Hocking River, Athens Ohio \n\nPicking up the phone after dialing the call is immediately answered. \u201cBonjour C\u2019est Deneuve\u201d replies the other line \u201cHi this is Madeline Koch the museum Director, you sent me an email earlier about a piece from the catacombs that you were looking to display?\u201d \u201cYes we can ship immediately, no cost, none at all we want to show more of the world what Paris has to offer, and we can send it right away.\u201d Slightly caught off guard but not going to let an opportunity slide Madeline gives her all of the shipping information for the museum. \u201cAur Revoir Madeline\u201d click.  A strange tension is felt about the conversation and Madeline can\u2019t figure out why they would send an unknown local museum in a different country a piece at no cost, even with no purchase cost they didn\u2019t even want the shipping paid? \u2018Well I\u2019ll deal with it when it shows up, if it shows up even\u2019 Picking up her cell again she calls Jeff to tell him to come by her office tomorrow. \n\nThe next morning Jeff apprehensively steps into her office, \u201cHey, is everything all right?\u201d knowing the museum isn\u2019t fairing too well Jeff is suspicious every time he gets asked to come in worrying for his job. \u201cEverything is fine, take a seat, we have a new piece coming in from France. I have no idea when it is arriving or really what it is, but I want you and Mike to clear out one of the exhibit rooms for when it shows up.\u201d  Jeff wrinkles and tilts his face \u201cVague, ahh okay sure thing boss, guessing you don\u2019t care about what exhibit we take down.\u201d Madeline just looks at him blankly answering his rhetorical question. \n\nChecking her emails, she comes across one from Mrs. Deneuve, \u2018The item has been shipped and will arrive within a few weeks. I hope your security is up to handling a piece like this, it cannot be stolen at any costs.\u2019 After reading the email Madeline sends an email to Jeff about installing cameras that actually work and a dollar amount that the project can\u2019t exceed. \n\nIn the next few weeks, a strange apprehension fills the halls of the museum, \u201c***coming soon***\u201d banners line the entrance to the main display room. The few patrons that do come by ask what it is going to be and the staff just has to answer with an \u201cOh just you wait and see\u201d because they are also waiting to see. \n\nNo one knows what it is that\u2019s coming, wishing they knew something so that they could advertise Madeline sends more inquiry emails and calls but the final call ending with a \u201cnumber disconnected\u201d message. With rising apprehension of the piece, she spends her days making sure everything is in order. Jeff has put the cameras up; he hasn\u2019t quite figured them out yet and they only display to his work laptop, but they are up. They rented a forklift, and it sits waiting in the display room. A night security guard position was even posted on a local job board incase this piece is really that important. Not knowing is driving her and all of the staff a bit sideways. \n\nThe piece arrived at 10:45 Pm three weeks after the email of it being shipped had been received and ten minutes before half of the cameras quit working. The night guard was on duty and informed the director and Jeff of its arrival, he had signed for, uncrated, and placed the piece in the exhibit. Seeing this Jeff did not pay any attention to the down cameras and decided to fix them in the morning. Upon arrival in the morning Jeff found a mess, the pieces of crate were still all over the place and a rat was hiding in the pieces. Calling Madeline Jeff realized that the night guard had not signed out of his shift realizing that he had probably just had the most intense night of work ever with the arrival of the piece he signed off on 4:30 Am and went back to cleaning. The next night the night guard was nowhere to be found, Jeff figured that the rat had given him a fright and he probably ran out of there and he would be back in a day or two embarrassed as hell. \n\nThe Natural Museum of Natural History on the banks of the Sein, Paris \n\nStanding in the dark room Madam Deneuve and two officials from the Louvre stare at the crate in silence. A long night had been spent watching the two officials, they worked in silence picking the Altar with a forklift and carefully packaging it to be transported. \u201cWe can handle this from here on, unfortunately this is not our first time removing something like this.\u201d One of the Louvre men said. Walking back to her office Madam Deneuve had a sick feeling that she had done something terribly wrong. After learning what the Altar was, she had called the Louvre for help and since then the entire situation had tumbled out of her hands. \u2018What do they mean not their first time dealing with something like this, how many times has this happened? How many times have they covered something like this up?\u2019 She thought to herself. Shortly after entering her office she noticed an envelope on her desk. She already knew that it would be some spook from the Louvre or the intelligence branch threatening her for silence. Deciding not to open it she pulled a bottle of cognac out of a desk drawer and poured a glass. As much as she wanted to speak out about this, she had just passed the barrier of making enough money to have something left over after taxes and she knew that she would not risk her job. Weighing on her heavily she walked to the door taking one last look at the envelope and closed her office for the night. \n\nOhio Museum Complex on the Hocking River, Athens Ohio\n\nThe piece itself was a disappointment, no one here would appreciate the history behind it and it was not a looker. A stone table, supposedly an altar stood in the middle of a room, surrounded by rope, surrounded by walls which were now slowly being filled with information on the catacombs. Almost the size of a church altar, the stone fixture looked rough, but it did not have any enticing value. A disappointment but what could have been expected from a free museum piece. Not looking any older than a concrete bench at the park no one who came in was impressed by it, and the museum once again sat in boring solitude. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about that kid.\u201d Madeline explained to Jeff \u201cHe\u2019s been gone for what two weeks now; I called the police station and they said that they would file a missing person but that he probably just got spooked and quit.\u201d Shifting in his chair Jeff replied \u201cProbably was just too much work for him, he was used to sitting in a chair on his phone all night and then he suddenly had to do some actual work. He probably just walked off thinking this was going to be a regular occurrence, sticking him with unloading the pieces.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it, and hey we still have the cameras, at least they pay attention.\u201d \n\nFewer and fewer people came in and those that did seemed to leave quickly after entering. Once again the museum was back to the boring monotony of day to day life. \u201cDusty shelfs full of dusty things\u201d Mike would say with a sadness when asked about the museum. Just as Mike was leaving a group of children entered along with their teachers for a tour. Smiling to the children Mike walked out of the building to head home. \n\nPushing open the museum doors and stepping under caution tape the head janitor Mike tries to get into the building. \"Can someone please explain to me what is going on?\" a man in a hazmat suit walks up \"Rat infestation\" comes a voice through a mask \"Someone complained about seeing one yesterday and there was a hell of a lot more than one. You're going to have to come back tomorrow we have to gas the building.\" Taking a couple steps back he begins to walk down the street to find a payphone. \"Hey, Jeff, what's up with this rat thing? I left my phone in the office and these guys wouldn't let me in. They said that they're gassing the building?\"\n\n\"Yeah... why don't you come over and see what I pulled off the cameras.\" Click. Walking through an unlocked door he shouts to Jeff, \"Jeff, Jeff what is going on\" \"Come look at this camera\u201d Jeff slides over his laptop \"Look at what we found in the new exhibit, ever since that altar came in from France, I've been finding rats. I thought it was the piece or the shipping container and I didn't say anything because it would have been on me for not clearing it... but... look\" clicking play on the video and squinting to see the screen Mike's eyes open in amazement. Two men enter the screen, dressed all in black they begin to pick up the altar when suddenly it falls back into place and where two men were there are now two rats.\n\n \"Ahhh is this a joke?\" Mike shakily asks, \"No chance, we doubled the security budget since that piece came in, the director told me that there might be attempts to steal it and we were not equipped to prevent any real attempts at stealing it. You didn\u2019t hear about that tour either did you? Jeff asked turning a ghostly white. In complete silence and shock Mike sat looking with cloudy eyes. \u201cI wont show you\u201d said Jeff \u201cBut that entire tour group went missing once the tour ended and they were given time to look around on their own. Since it was such a large group that went missing everyone had assumed that they had walked home and forgotten that the bus was picking them up.\u201d\n\nIn silence the two men sit facing the computer screen in complete wonder at what they had seen, Mike in shock over what he had learned. His shock and grief turning into fear \"How do we tell anyone about this? we will lose our jobs, were going to get fired just for trying to bring this up, Jeff I'm 5 years away from retirement I am not getting fired.\" \"Don't worry we won\u2019t be getting fired, we won\u2019t be because I am deleting this footage and we aren't going to tell anyone a damn thing. Keep it quiet and DO NOT touch that altar. It isn\u2019t possible that whoever sent it didn\u2019t know. And we WILL be shipping it back. \n\n1:45 AM, Ohio Museum Complex\n\nAfter careful planning Mike and Jeff began their work of removing the Altar, unknowingly by the same means that it had been sent to them. Loading it with the forklift and crating up the piece the men personally loaded it onto the truck for shipping. Jeff had snuck into Madeline\u2019s office and found the museum it had come from and shipped it directly there. It would be taken to a boat on shore, brought down the Hocking to the Ohio, down the Ohio to the Mississippi, and from the Mississippi to the gulf, loaded on to a ship and sent across the Atlantic unloaded on the Seine and taken directly to the Museum. They did not know if the museum could even receive shipping from the river but they had paid and promised extra upon confirmed delivery. Without speaking the two had loaded it onto the boat and watched it disappear down the river. On their way in they had killed power to the building and Mike had called the city and told them to drop the alarms that he was there trying to find the source of the outage. Mike and Jeff gave each other a nod and walked to their cars to head home. \n\nIn the morning Madeline had called both of them panicking about the missing Altar, they knew that she would find the note that they had left for her once she calmed down. Their letter had stated that it needed to leave and had been returned to where it belonged, and had plainly asked to trust them and let it go. \n\nThe Natural Museum of Natural History on the banks of the Sein, Paris\n\nMadam Deneuve had arrived to work to find the piece had been returned and she immediately called the Louvre officials. \u201cTake it and do with it what you want but I will no longer be involved, it will be sent to the bottom of the river before it comes back inside of my museum.\u201d And hung up the phone. Thinking on whatever hardships she had brought that small museum in the states she stood up and walked out of her office. The men on the river had not yet moved their boat. Walking aboard she found the man working the crane and asked \u201cWhat will it cost for you to dump that crate in the river for me.\u201d",
        "this story happened in early september 2019 in Greece.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was working at the airport at the time,my shift ended I got to the bus and was on my way home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\na little before the bus reached the bus stop I usually take I heard an old man(somewhere around 75-85 years old)talking to the bus driver.\n\nthe old man was holding some piece of paper and was asking the bus driver to take the bus to a specific adress.\n\nI offered to help the old man.\n\nhe gave me the piece of paper.\n\nthat piece of paper was entirely written at english it said\"patient id\"the name of some clinic(I think it was london pathology,I don't remember the exact name,it certainly had the word pathology in it) and some information about the old man.\n\n(keep in mind that most old people in greece aren't very good at speaking engish,so there is a good chance he didn't know what the word patient meant).\n\nthe adress sounded foreign,so I doubt if there was anywhere in the country,I quickly realized that the oldman is a dementia patient so I offered to help him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwe got to the next bus station,I called the police so they come and pick him and said the old man that I called a friend instead.\n\nwe were waiting there for 2 whole hours and the police was nowhere to be seen.\n\n(there was a point while we were waiting where he got convinced that his house was\"just a few blocks away\" and at a point he asked me if I was his neighbour,I didn't know if it was okay to say no so I just pretended to be his neighbour).\n\nany way,in the end we took a taxi,the taxi driver took us to the nearest police station,the old man was still convinced that his house was \"just a few blocks away\",I managed to convince the police that he was a dementia patient(even though the old man refused to give his patient id),the officers told me that I was free to go and that the old man is no longer my responsibility.\n\nso I left.\n\nend of story.",
        "So I just woke up from this crazy realistic dream where I was in my room and I got attacked by these bugs that kept coming out of the furnace in my room you know the thing where heat comes out? I'm taking about that anyway. These bugs kept bitting and Stingo me. And the it turns out the furnace was broken so we had to fix it.

        "Okay, so here\u2019s a story about something that happened to me back when I was 14 years old. During the time that this story took place, I was in 9th grade, and I would go with my younger brother (who was in middle school) when he went to practice football with his team. Anyway, my brother\u2019s football team was just sort of a group of around 10 kids who were all from from highly-religious families and would meet up and throw a ball around. There was one kid, who was named Andrew, that was a hardcore hypochondriac. This kid would fucking wear bubble wrap all over his body whenever he played football, because he was afraid of accidentally falling, scraping his body and \u201cgetting gangrene\u201d (his exact words). My brother befriended this kid, mainly because he felt sorry for him, and they would call eachother on Skype and sometimes play Minecraft together. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter my buddy, let\u2019s call him V, and I. V was my friend from up the street, and we would always talk on skype to plan when and where we were going to hang out. We also liked to make our profile pictures on skype weird and random shit, mainly images of sex offenders that we got from registries. Anyway, one day my brother decided to add me and V to a call with Andrew, without knowing that we had set our profile pictures to random sex offenders. Andrew instantly hung up on us and blocked my brother on Skype. At the time, we thought the whole situation was funny, and we made jokes about how Andrew had probably hung up the call to go masturbate to our profile pictures. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast forward a couple of days to the next day my brother went to football practice. When we arrived, Andrew\u2019s Mom was standing near the bleachers with an angry look on her face. My parents and I came up and sat near her (my family would usually sit close to their family), and she started talking to us, blurting out \u201cAre you aware that our children were talking to PEDOPHILES online?!?!\u201d My Mom knew that I was involved somehow, and she turned and stared at me as if to say \u201cexplain the evils you have committed.\u201d I told Andrew\u2019s Mom that the \u201cpedophiles\u201d were just me and my friend messing around, I explained that we had an odd sense of humor and just did that sort of thing as a joke. She looked at me with disgust, before getting up and moving away from my family. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next time that my brother went to football practice, Andrew\u2019s mother was standing near the gate to the field with two bibles in her hands. She handed them to me when I walked by and said \u201cHere, I think you need this. Take one for your friend too.\u201d I awkwardly accepted them, then I left the field and called my friend on my flip-phone. We laughed for a solid hour. Later that night, we took the two bibles to the 7/11 parking lot and gave them to some random kids.",

        "It seemed throughout my grade school days, no matter which grade I was in, there was a girl who hated me for seemingly no reason. It was a different girl for each school, but through 3rd and 5th grade there was a girl named Leia. Keep that in mind because it\u2019s going to be important later.\n\nAnyways this story took place on a cold sunny day in the winter in Southern California. The elementary school I was at from 3rd through 5th grade had a courtyard where most kids, including me, liked to sit and eat lunch. Something you should know about me is that I have black hair so I tend to get hot faster than most people when I\u2019m out in the sun. But anyways, there was a wall lined with those chairs that have built in desks, half in the sun and half in the shade. Because it was cold, I decided to sit in the sunny area and eat. But during my lunch, I noticed I was getting hot, so I decided to move to the shade, not paying any attention to my surroundings. But as I was eating, a cold breeze blew over me, causing me to ditch the shade for the sun again. This hopping back and fourth lasted until I was done with my lunch.\n\nFrom that day on, whenever Leia argued with me, she always accused me of constantly sitting next to her at lunch one time which I denied because not only did I never do anything to provoke her (she was the one who always started confrontations), but I had no recollection of ever doing that to her. But during one confrontation with her when she brought it up I was about to deny it as usual, when suddenly it dawned on me: the cold sunny day when I kept moving seats, that was the day she was referring to! Apparently whenever I moved seats, I sat next to her without realizing it (she kept moving seats every time I sat down). \n\nWhen I realized this, I began to laugh and explained to her what really happened on that day, though considering how much she hated me, I don\u2019t think she ever believed me.",
        "Funny story of me being fired from my cafe over one ice block, 1/2 teaspoon of tea and the correct customer order. \n\nIce block\nThe smoothies we make all require 4 ice blocks except for the Berry smoothie which needs 5 (There's 5 different smoothies). I was making a Berry smoothie and miscounted a single ice block and the manager went off at me. She quote on quote said \"it's all wrong I'm disappointed in you\". For missing one single ice block which makes no difference in a smoothie. \n\n1/2 tea spoon of tea \nWhen we make tea, we use 1.5 teaspoons of tea. I am new and didn't know. So I put 2 teaspoons of tea. My manager asked \"how much tea do we put in?\" I said \"2\". She came back with \"no, no it's all wrong. You have to put one in a half teaspoons of tea\". Then got all distressed over an 1/2 teaspoons of tea. Because someone is going to really care and even notice that 1/2 of extra tea.\n\nThe correct customer order\nSomeone ordered a cup of latte. I couldn't find the cup of latte on the till. So I put mug of latte, went to commands and typed cup instead of mug. Charged them for the latte. My manager came over and said \"it is all wrong. Your performance is so bad\" as the customer receives their cup of latte right in front of the manager. The company got the money, the customer got their latte and no losses were made. Yet the manager went off at me for giving the customer the order they wanted.",

        "A few weekends ago, I decided to visit a state park about two hours away from me and take some photographs of the scenery. I wanted to go to the hiking trails, but my phone kept sending me to the campgrounds. I was given a map when I asked the campground attendant for directions to the hiking trails. I found one of the parking lots, but it was full. With the way the road was directed, I couldn\u2019t simply turn around. I had to follow the one-way road that dumped me somewhere else in the park. I spent about an hour or so driving around just trying to get back on track. \n\nI found the park\u2019s post office, which was right on top of a blind hill. The speed limit there is 55mph. I decided to turn into the post office to look at the map and figure out where I need to go. Just as I was into the parking lot, someone came flying up the hill and nearly t-boned me (I know, I would have been at fault had I been struck). I didn\u2019t see the other car until I was already turned. There was a park ranger outside the post office who started watching as soon as he heard the sound of the screeching tires. When I got into the parking lot, he came over to my car to ensure I was safe and okay to drive again. We chatted for a few minutes, I got directions to the hiking trails, and calmed down enough to get back on the road again. Thankfully, all that came out of that situation was flurry of emotions. \n\nUnfortunately, as I was leaving I saw that same park ranger responding to a call where someone wasn\u2019t as lucky as I was. A deer collided with a biker, knocking the biker unconscious. I didn\u2019t witness the scene itself, this came from someone else who did. I know the biker regained consciousness and the ranger called an ambulance and that\u2019s it. God bless that man and hopefully the biker is doing well, too.",

        "I still remember that night. The night I realized.... everything is good. You know what, I fucking hated that night. I learned that night that there is a pain worse than feeling like you'll never heal, it's healing and realizing you hate losing the pain. All I had been working towards all summer was to feel the way I did that night: relaxed, at peace, motivated, happy. Depression and anxiety have torn me apart for years, and I just wanted a break. The one night I get a break what do I do? What does my fucked up hopeless piece of shit do? I open the drawer, lift the knife out, pull on the blade till I hear the \\*click\\*, then I start using my own body as the canvas for this horrible form of art. I didn't sleep at all that night, I remember how the light hurt my eyes, I remember how the music pierced my ears, I remember feeling so numb inside that I couldn't even cry. I remember the anger and the fear. The meds finally worked, the anti-depressants I fought so hard to get and I hated it. It was like I was two twins, each with very opposite personalities, but they couldn't be separated without hurting the other. I felt like I had cut out a twin inside me. I wasn't myself, the depression defines me, and without it I'm nothing. I have to hold onto it, so every night I find myself in the same place. Making art; my own blood as the ink, and my skin as the canvas. Goodbye.",
        " \n\nDaughter wanted Boobs more than anything, and because Father was the only obstacle she could see, she hated him. As a baby, she remembered gasping with anticipated delight and excitement at the prospect of Boobs coming close, the sheer wonder of warm nutritious goodness flowing into her, and then the absolute misery of Boobs leaving. More and more she realised Boobs would leave when Father was close by, or sometimes he would actually physically pluck her away from Boobs, and she would shriek and howl with despair and fury. She couldn\u2019t sleep at night unless she was physically nestled under Boobs, the warm scented softness pressing into her cheeks, knowing she could tug and release the joy of food whenever she needed. Boobs kept her close by, except when she didn\u2019t, and Daughter refused to get used to it, and also hated Father more and more.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Daughter grew older and she ate other foods too, but none gave her so much joy as what she got from Boobs. She refused to give up, and she could hear Father and Boobs arguing about it and she didn\u2019t care. She knew Father wanted Boobs for himself, she had seen him handle them, the Boobs which were meant for her, for her joy and growth and strength, and she shook with hatred. She would destroy him, she vowed to herself. She watched cartoons and saw creatures like Father being destroyed. Burnt, hit with large hammers, pushed off cliffs, run over by cars. She would do that, and keep Boobs all to herself. One time she saw a match on the ground, picked it up and tried to put it under his feet and set it alight like they did in the cartoons, but she couldn\u2019t do that. Not yet. She knew a time would come when she could. She was growing smarter and stronger every day, with all the intense goodness she was getting from Boobs.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Her teeth grew in sharp, sharp and brand new, but she still didn\u2019t want to give up Boobs. Boobs was her delight and joy, she became anxious and distressed when Boobs wasn\u2019t close by, when she couldn\u2019t smell the delicious scent and hear her voice. But Boobs seemed to leave her more and more, other people would give her disgusting thick sloppy foods to eat or fluids out of hard cold cups. Daughter would eat, because there was no sign of Boobs, but she was angry, and when Boobs eventually returned, she couldn\u2019t help herself, she bit them hard with her sharp new teeth sinking into their warm softness. Boobs cried out in pain and Daughter tasted her tangy thin warm blood, so different from the goodness which flowed so freely from her. Boobs was marked with Daughter\u2019s bitemarks.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Father said that was enough, Daughter was almost two years old and she needed to stop completely. Daughter had to sleep in a different room and couldn\u2019t sleep in Boobs and Father\u2019s bed anymore. It was hard, but needed to be done. Daughter was put in a different room.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The first couple of nights was almost unbearable, and Daughter was sure she would die. Not quietly though. She screamed and howled and banged on the walls. Father came and gave her sips of water and stinky milk, tried to console her and but Daughter couldn\u2019t stop raging. After a few nights though, the howling intensity went away. The hatred for Father remained though. She thought long and hard about different ways to destroy him,\u00a0all the time. Even though she didn\u2019t need Boobs like she used to, she would never forgive him. And she knew the day would come she would destroy him for what he had done to her and Boobs. And she and Boobs would live happily together, forever and forever.\u00a0",

He had dipped dangerously low on a particular mineral before one of the female humans had dragged him in, insisting he was \u2018off-color.\u2019 Fourth Sister had not noted a change in his outer membrane but had learned to trust the humans\u2019 risk assessment if nothing else.\n\n\u201cThe humans dug a giant hole, put the storage tanks in them, and then back-filled the holes with the removed dirt,\u201d Idlesintheshallows replied.\n\n\u201cA fairly standard solution,\u201d Fourth Sister replied. \u201cMaking use of the insulating properties of dry land is a most efficient process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the strange thing,\u201d Idlesintheshallows went on. \u201cWe had no excavation equipment at the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas there some on requisition?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there was,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was several months out, and the humans were in a hurry to get the hydrocarbons underground before the monsoons moved in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe electrical discharge would be a major problem,\u201d Fourth Sister admitted. \u201cHow did they solve the problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019d just gotten a bunch of fresh rangers, so they printed out a bunch of shovels\u2014\u201d Idlesintheshallows stopped talking as one of the many display screens along the wall began to flicker amber. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked, shifting curiously in the water toward the light.\n\n\u201cA medical alert,\u201d Fourth Sister replied. \u201cLow grade it is not\u2014\u201d She stopped talking as the light shifted from amber to red.\n\n\u201cIt looks like it is now,\u201d Idlesintheshallows observed. \u201cWho is that, and why aren\u2019t the readouts in a readable format?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe humans value their privacy in medical matters,\u201d Fourth Sister said as she quickly gathered her kit. \u201cI must leave you here. Please do not touch anything.\u201d\n\nIdlesintheshallows gave a hum of agreement and slipped back under the surface as she left the office at a brisk skip. It took her some time to reach the human\u2019s location on the other side of the base. The middle-aged woman was bent over the open top of one of the power generators.\n\n\u201cFirst Mechanic,\u201d Fourth Sister called out, \u201cI am here to tend to your medical needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy what now?\u201d the woman asked, glancing up sharply at the medic.\n\nFourth Sister hesitated and considered the situation. The woman\u2019s face was creased with stress indicators, and her shoulders were hunched defensively. However she did seem genuinely perplexed, and as remote as the possibility was, the equipment might be malfunctioning. She held up the display and showed the elevated hormone levels to the human.\n\n\u201cWhy are you even monitoring those?\u201d First Mechanic demanded.\n\n\u201cFor the study from the Centauri university,\u201d Fourth Sister explained, her antennae curling in surprise; she thought First Mechanic had consented to the study with the rest of the base.\n\nThe human heaved a sigh and reached her gloved hand up to rub across her face. The dirty protective surface left smears of conductive gel on the skin, and Fourth Sister couldn\u2019t quite hide a wince.\n\n\u201cForgot about that scrapit,\u201d the human cursed softly. \u201cGuess I\u2019d better tell you about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Fourth Sister asked with a confused flick of her frill.\n\nThe human sighed again and bent back to her task. \u201cI have a little genetic oddity,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt makes my mineral content fluctuate unexpectedly. I have the therapy for it, but it\u2019s too close to some pretty important gene markers to turn it off or mess with it much at all. I\u2019m usually pretty stable, but every so often some environmental thing knocks my mineral content sideways, and then I get a little distracted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you report this imbalance before your hormones were affected?\u201d Fourth Sister asked.\n\nThe human shrugged. \u201cI have an appointment set up to get it rebalanced,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no reason to bother you. You have enough to do with the study.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d Fourth Sister said, \u201cyou need to come back to the medical ward with\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d First Mechanic stated abruptly.\n\n\u201cPardon me?\u201d Fourth Sister said, curling her antennae back in affront.\n\n\u201cLook, Fourth,\u201d First Mechanic said, \u201cI know my limits, I might be having a bit of a tough go of it right now, but I am perfectly capable of working through it.\u201d\n\n\u201c*It* is a series of medical conditions that every line of data I have says can lead to death,\u201d Fourth Sister stated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to snap,\u201d First Mechanic growled. \u201cIt\u2019s just a few days.\u201d\n\nFourth Sister pulled up the list of symptoms that was attached to First Mechanic\u2019s database in a minor subfolder. \u201cAnxiety attacks? Panic attacks? Temporary disruption of your central fluid pump?\u201d Fourth Sister demanded. \u201cThese are hardly\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d the human snapped as she rose from her work and shut the lid with more force than was strictly necessary. \u201cI can be miserable trapped in my quarters, or I can be miserable and productive at work.\u201d\n\nFourth Sister hesitated. The logic was fairly sound. Humans were notorious for the degradation of their mental state under periods of inactivity.\n\n\u201cI will be monitoring your biometrics closely,\u201d Fourth Sister said.\n\n\u201cYou do that, Moon Pie,\u201d First Mechanic replied as she shouldered her work bag and proceeded to the next junction.  \n\nFourth Sister tilted her triangular head to look after her in confusion as she left. When the human rounded a corner, the Shatar turned and walked slowly back to the medical bay. Idlesintheshallows was circling the bottom of the sink, clearly deep in thought. She resumed her place and had been working for some time when he finally rose to the surface and angled his appendages at the wall of observation charts.\n\n\u201cIt is still reading in the danger zone,\u201d he observed.\n\n\u201cThe human has chosen to work through the issue,\u201d Fourth Sister informed him.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cFeel free to propose a theory of your own,\u201d Fourth Sister said as she bent over her work.\n\n# [Humans are Weird \u2013 Anxiety Attack - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/SKEWcfb-bu4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBook 1 \"[\u200b](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)Humans are Weird: I Have the Data\"\n\n[Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RSVHL81)\n\n[Barnes & Nobe (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/humans-are-weird-adelia-gibadullina/1138927933;jsessionid=CED1CA2DD868CAE60C7F4EAC8FEDD5E5.prodny_store01-atgap01?ean=9781736003923)\n\n[Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=USta%20eBook%20by%20Betty%20Adams%20-%201230004645337%20%7C%20Rakuten%20Kobo%20United%20States)\n\n[Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# [Humans are Weird: We Took A Vote BOOK 2 | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)",
        "I've told this story before, but the house is quiet and somehow I started thinking about old family members who've since passed away, and felt like telling it again, maybe with a bit more detail.\n\nMy great Uncle Charles wasn't what you'd call an exciting man. He worked wrapping gifts at an upscale department store, and lived in a small Detroit apartment with his elderly mother. Everyone called her Granny. No one in my family remembers a young Granny, she had seemingly always been granny, always hard of hearing, sitting in the same chair, fiddling with the hearing aid unit tucked into her bra.\n\nCharles wrapped gifts and was Granny's caretaker, and did little else. He was a confirmed bachelor. These days we'd just say he was gay, but back then, he was a confirmed bachelor. Charles had diabetes in a time when the best treatment wasn't all that great. I imagine being gay and tied to your mother and carrying needles didn't help his social life.\n\nOn the 2nd of May, nearly 40 years ago, Charles died. His gravestone has room for 2 names. His side, which reads \"dearest son\", and an empty spot for Granny. She passed away a dozen years later on the other side of the continent. The grave marker will be 1/2 complete forever.\n\nTo finish the story, I need to tell you about a backpack. \n\nBut not a backpack you'd carry school books or your lunch. This was a proper hiking backpack. Large, bright orange, and covered with pockets and straps. The kind of backpack you'd own for a week in the wilderness or trekking across europe. The backpack was sent to us as Charles apartment was cleaned out.\n\nAs the box of belongings was being put away, my dad held up the backpack and paused, saying \"Charles must have had some great dreams\". The backpack was clearly unused.\n\nThe backpack traveled with our family through years of camping and hiking trips. The bug spray went in the side pocket, the PB&J sandwiches went under the big flap on top. It's probably still in the camper, under the seat, waiting for the next trip.\n\nI don't know if the backpack was part of Charles unfulfilled dreams, or just unsold merchandise clearly out of place in an urban department store.  Either way, I guess the important part is just remembering someone who perhaps might not be remembered at all.",

I was writing a story about something and at the corner of my eye, I saw a black and white head appearing at my doorway. I looked over there and it was gone. I'm actually frightened by it. My door was open and one light was open but barely lighting up my doorway. It's not appearing again and now I'm gonna pray that I don't wake up with a demon above my head, lock my bedroom doors, and sleep with a nightlight on. Good night guys.

He wanted to spare them peacefully or they will all perish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a deal. Message got through the advanced equipment of the Terraints. Phil agreed to the terms.

Lunch comes around and I'm lining up to head into the lunch hall. All of a sudden I start feeling rather dizzy and my eyes start to close. I have never been through this before so I'm a bit confused. I suddenly pass out and from a witnesses perspective I completely tore down the choices chart that every primary schools has. I wake up five minutes later but what feels like five seconds later. As every normal human would, I thought i was having a nightmare it was that intense, so I point my finger to the sky and as if trying to summon the bifrost i splutter out in a very dazed voice \"ExIt dREaM\". Poor Jamie thought i was pointing at him and got very scared. I managed to gain semi consciousness and propped myself up on a chair. Then it happened again but this time I woke up on the floor on some pillows from the reading corner. The deputy head brought me some water.

What is your old name scary or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you can say my old name is scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs if Frankenstein or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, not that kind of scary, but it is scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on dad, just tell me!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you get older, I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, honey I\u2019m not sure if mommy\u2019s name is really Shannon!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs her real name scary too?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, her old name, I think is scary too, but I\u2019m not 100% sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour not sure if you know mommy\u2019s real name or even your real name?\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically, yes, and if the real names are who I think they are, then they\u2019re scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long did you know this?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether if I\u2019m really Mitchell? Yesterday, and whether if your mother is really Shannon, well that was when we drove to your dance competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you talking about the guy who changed our tire, who was calling mommy, Kimberly?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that you heard that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I did and even if Kimberly is mom\u2019s real name, then that\u2019s not scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell your right honey, the name Kimberly really isn\u2019t scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what did you mean then!\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing honey!\u201d\n\n\u201cDad, you better tell me or I\u2019ll make a TikTok video about the weird riddle you just told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrace, the only thing that I\u2019m mostly certain about right now is that you can never tell anyone, what I just told you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you better tell me something, right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, do you remember that old VHS tape I got at the flea market?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf that \u2018Children of the Corn\u2019 movie?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and just by looking at the tape itself, nothing really seemed scary, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tape just had someone\u2019s handwriting with the name of the movie on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly, so say that video with just the name written on it was mommy and me!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen when we played the tape, then it got really scary?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I couldn\u2019t watch more than a few minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! Now let\u2019s say that I had erased that movie, so when you put the movie in the VHS player after being erased, there was nothing but a gray screen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou we\u2019re once scary and now your not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid that also happen with mommy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure mommy is like that old VHS tape as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat got erased?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, because she didn\u2019t hurt her head?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good conclusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad, I\u2019m confused.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know honey, so am I.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes that mean you or mom might hurt me?\u201d\n\n\u201cHoney, I would never harm you!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, what about mom?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has never hurt you in the past? Has she?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so!\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither, do I.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes that mean that you and mommy have hurt other people?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember ever hurting anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause your like the VHS tape that got erased, but mommy\u2019s VHS tape didn\u2019t get erased?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like you did a good job of understanding my analogy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks dad, but I\u2019m really confused.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo am I honey!\u201d\n\nI continue to drive on I-95, where I would look at Grace in the rear view mirror and see nothing more than a look of confusion on her face, however, I don\u2019t think she realizes that what I told her is just the tip of the iceberg, where me and her mother are probably not her real parents.  But if Grace thought about what I told her long enough, then she would probably come to that question or conclusion.  As far as right now, I\u2019m just hoping that she doesn\u2019t ask me that question of whose her real parents.\n\nWe finally get to Bangor, where Grace has been sleeping for the past couple of  hours.\n\nI see \u201cmy wife\u2019s\u201d car parked in the parking lot of the Hotel Bixbey.\n\nThere\u2019s only a few cars parked in the parking lot, so I assume her room is the one with the light on in front of her car.\n\n\u201cHoney, it\u2019s time to wake up!\u201d\n\nGrace looks really groggy and says \u201cdad, where are we?\u201d with a confused look on her face.\n\n\u201cWhere at the hotel, where your mother is staying.\u201d\n\nWe both get out of the car and walk towards the hotel room together.\n\nI have a million thoughts and emotions going through my mind, as I have no idea what will await us on the other side of the hotel door.\n\nI take a deep breath and knock on the door.\n\n\u201cShannon\u201d answers the door.\n\n\u201cBaby, I missed you so much.\u201d Shannon says as she answers the door and gives Grace a hug.\n\nI\u2019m looking at \u201cmy wife\u201d differently now, since I\u2019ve learned that she\u2019s probably been impersonating my original wife, \u201cShannon\u201d however, I don\u2019t think I was ever married to a Shannon.\n\nRegardless, I look at \u201cmy wife\u201d as I looked at a rerun of Bill Cosby, the other day, on The Bill Cosby show, where like Bill Cosby, that wholesome image of my wife is no longer there.\n\nAfter looking at Shannon, I look around the room and I see a handgun on the nightstand between the two twin beds.\n\nI\u2019m already wound up not knowing what to expect and after seeing the gun, just makes me 10 times more nervous.  I\u2019m not sure if I should make a mad dash for the gun or not and ultimately I decide not to.\n\nAfter, Grace and her mother exchange pleasantries, the two of them sit down on one of the beds, where Grace sits the closest to the gun.\n\nI think Grace was so overwhelmed with seeing her mother, that she doesn\u2019t even notice a gun is within two feet of her.\n\nI sit on the adjacent bed, where I\u2019m continuing to survey the scene.\n\nTo me, it looks like Shannon stills has some type of maternal instinct towards Grace.\n\n\u201cMom, dad told me something really strange in the car, when we were driving here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that Grace, what did your father tell you?\u201d Shannon responds.\n\n\u201cHe said that your really not Shannon and he\u2019s really not Mitchell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to tell you this honey, but he\u2019s right.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo who are you Mom? And who\u2019s dad?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was a little girl, many people did bad things to me and I never learned to cope with stress in an appropriate manner, so when I got older I turned to using drugs and alcohol to try to make my bad memories go away.  I didn\u2019t go to college and the only jobs I could get was working at fast food places, which didn\u2019t last long, because I was always hungover on the job. So, I decided to work in daycare with little kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did that job go?\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of me said that I should never work with little kids and I should of listened to that part of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne day when I was working at the daycare, I wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind and I saw those little kids as being me when I was a little girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cBaby, I hurt those little kids and I feel so awful that I did that.\u201d\n\nGrace does nothing more than look completely shocked.  She really has no idea how to respond.\n\nShannon who just confessed to being Kimberly looked like she was about to cry, but sucked it up and maintains a stoic look on her face.\n\nGrace, with very little  emotion, asks \u201cwhat about dad?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell honey, I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life in some mental institution or some prison, so I escaped and ran away, but before I ran away, I visited this woman, who I used to buy illegal drugs from.  When I went into the woman\u2019s house, she was passed out from doing too much drugs and I saw you walking around the house crying, so on a whim I took you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you take me?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause, I thought by taking you, I would stop taking drugs and drinking alcohol, which actually did work, where when I assumed the role of being your mother, I stopped drinking and doing drugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, your not my real mom?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, your kind of adopted.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about dad?\u201d\n\n\u201cI took you and put you in the car and I drove and drove as far as I could.  When we got to this really remote area in West Virginia, I saw that this car had collided with a telephone poll.  When I inspected the car further, I saw that your father was unconscious behind the wheel.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you call 911?\u201d Grace asked.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t honey, because I didn\u2019t want to get turned into the police and when I inspected your father\u2019s car further, I saw that there was a newspaper clipping that read \u201cJosiah Smith is still on the run\u201d and when I checked your father\u2019s wallet, I saw that his name was Josiah Smith.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dragged him into our car and I drove very far away to where we live now and brought him to the hospital.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you tell the people at the hospital?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told them that your father, was \u2018zoning out\u2019 at work and he banged his head, which the hospital\u2019s doctors wrongly diagnosed him as having a stroke, but truthfully, telling them that your father had \u2018zoned out\u2019 already put the idea in their heads, that he must of had a stroke.  He just had a head injury from the car accident that mirrored a stroke on a MRI, where he probably intentionally harmed himself by driving into the telephone poll.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did the newspaper in dad\u2019s car say that he did?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father did bad things to older people!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you did bad things to kids and dad did bad things to older people?\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect!\u201d  \n\nGrace has a really horrified look on her face like both me and \u201cher mother\u201d are ghosts.\n\n\u201cI want you to pick up that gun Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cShannon, I mean Kimberly,\u201d I try to interject.\n\nGrace picks up the gun.\n\n\u201cHoney, I want you to shoot me and dad, if you want to.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m left completely tongue tied, where I\u2019m not sure if killing me and Kimberly is the wrong thing to do.\n\nGrace looks at me and Kimberly with a poker face, where I can\u2019t really read what she\u2019s thinking, but as her assumed father, I feel really bad for her, knowing that she just found out that we\u2019re not her real parents and that we are both nothing more than psychotic degenerates.\n\nMy mind braces itself that I might get shot, where the tension is becoming really overwhelming with watching Grace with the gun in her hand.\n\n\u201cKnock, knock\u201d I hear at the door.  \u201cHousekeeping, I have the extra towels that you requested\u201d a female voice says.\n\nKimberly and I look at each other not knowing what to say.\n\n\u201cCome in!\u201d Grace unexpectedly says.\n\nThe female housekeeper comes into the room and looks absolutely startled as she sees Grace holding a gun.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on. Are you alright?\u201d  The housekeeper asks Grace.\n\nGrace, without hesitation points the gun at the housekeeper and shoots her in the head.\n\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d I yell out loud.\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m like you, mom and dad!\u201d\n\nI rush towards the housekeeper and see that she\u2019s dead.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d I frantically say.\n\nKimberly looks over at Grace and says \u201cHow do you like the name Mary?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay with that name, but I always liked the name Ariel.\n\nKimberly looks over at Grace and says \u201cFine, Arial it is and now I\u2019m Mary.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about you, Mitchell?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess I always liked the name Ivan.\u201d I say while nervously shaking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, it sounds too ethnic!\u201d my wife responds.\n\n\u201cWe can discuss it more in the car. Come on mom and dad, let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d",
        "So I'm working in Germany with a brigade of 4 guys, they are my father in law friends, they are much older than me around 45 yrs old while I'm 23, as usual in the weekends we would get drunk, after drinking I went to sleep and was woken up from the screams of my colleagues who were claiming that I took a piss on the floor and went to sleep, I didn't remember any of it and feel so embarrassed, anyone has something like that happen to them?",
        "The execution of Robert Johnstone\u2026\n\nThe date was the 30th of December 1818, Robert Johnstone if it hadn't been for the circumstances of his execution probably would be a name long since forgotten, his crimes had been considerably petty. \n\nHe'd been sentenced to death for robbery and today was the day of his execution.\n\n'I have just returned from being an involuntary witness to one of the most horrible scenes which ever disgraced the execution of public justice.' This was a statement from a witness after Robert Johnstone\u2019s execution. \n\nToday was the day Robert Johnstone was going to meet his final end, shivering with fear he was led to the gallows. The magistrates have gathered around the scaffold ready to witness his execution.\n\nThe hangman places the rope around Robert Johnstone\u2019s neck. Some of the crowd turn their back at the final moment as the hangman hoists him into the air. \n\nSuddenly the crowd is silent, very different from the normal jeers of the entertainment of the day, very few could bare to watch as Robert Johnstone execution went tragically wrong. \n\nNow this sounds like the normal statement to make, how can an execution go wrong? The hangman had made the rope slightly too long. \n\nRobert Johnstone\u2019s toes could just touch the ground where he was standing. Instead of being hoisted into the air and strangled quickly his body was involuntary fighting back. He was slowly being choked. \n\nAs the crowd gasped Robert Johnstone tried to speeden up the execution himself, hitching his legs up into the air however once he became tired his legs naturally fell down holding him up once again. This occured two or three times, a desperate attempt to end his own life quicker. \n\nThe magistrates stand there quiet, passively with absolutely no idea how to deal with the situation. After a few moments carpenters arrive trying to cut the ground away from underneath him. This makes no difference and the crowd now growing angry start to throw rocks the magistrates, both the hangman and the magistrates retreat to safety, far from view of the horrible sight in front of them. \n\nMeanwhile a member of the crowd has eventually fought his way through, climbed up onto the scaffold and cut Robert Johnstone down, in agonising pain however stll breathing and alive. \n\nHe's now been released from his torture but not from his sentence. The crowd sympathised with the horrible ordeal he's been through, but their sympathy does not extend to a pardon. \n\nThe crowd then start to jeer themselves 'no rescue, no rescue, no rescue.' Johnson is taken to the police station, as the crowds follow the door is bolted behind them. \n\nSome of the crowd start to disperse assuming the day's entertainment is over unfortunately a short while later having recovered from his horrible ordeal Robert Johnstone is led back to the gallows and successfully executed, no rescue for Robert Johnstone",

        "Keep in mind that I've never really don't anyone about this until now. This story is real, and occurred around 4th grade. \n\nOne night I was scrolling through Netflix trying to find a decent show to watch when a close family friend sat next to me on the couch. (We were close enough that me and my sister's could sit on his lap and it wouldn't concern my overly protective parents) I could feel his eyes staring at me but didn't want to say anything because I was getting a bad vibe.\n\nWe'll call him O. After staring at me for a while O started talking, he was pretty drunk and his words were slurred. He started saying things like \"you're different from your siblings, you're really special.\" Shitty things like that to make me feel good about myself, he wasn't saying it in the compliment kind of way though. He said it with an alarming intensity.\n\nHe started to talk more \"sexual\" saying things like \"me and you could be together, but people don't like that. Did you know that when I was your age I dated a 29 year old girl?\" (He was 29.) and my panic grew, as he started to talk stranger and stranger. He had gotten really close to me now, our skin was almost touching. He glanced at my parents bedroom and licked his lips, and asked \"are your parents home?\" All my red flags went off, they were gone at the store. I replied with \"ya they're in their bedroom\" forcing my voice to be steady.\n\n\"Oh\" he sighed, his disappointment obvious. Then fear flashed through his eyes \"Don't tell Tee about this ok?\" he told me nervously. Tee is the nickname for my stepdad, and he would beat his ass if he figured out what O had just done and said. After determining I wouldn't tell O took his hand off my thigh and went to the bathroom where he puked his guts out from drinking too much alcohol.\n\nYears later I still worry about what exactly would've happened if I had been more naive and said they weren't home. How badly would that have ended?",
        "Chronicles of a Nanny \n\nPART ONE:\n\nSo this is something totally out of my comfort zone. I\u2019m used to the same mundane life day after day, night after night. The fan is roaring in the background.. I lay here watching my boyfriend get dressed. He\u2019s getting ready to go pick us up some take out; wings to share. It\u2019s 10pm so I tell him to please be careful, not because it\u2019s just a polite thing to do, but because I truly could not live without him if something ever happened to him and I truly mean that. He is my best friend, my safe place, anywhere with him\u2014 is home.\n\nMy boyfriend is handsome, humble & frankly perfect in every way a boyfriend could be. He\u2019s attentive, he supports me, he loves me, he apologizes and changes. He\u2019s even supported me through some of my darkest moments.

It\u2019s hard to explain how I even ended up in this situation in the first place , especially with such a great partner.

        "\"That'll be twenty seventy five,\" Vick said in his customer service voice while wearing a smile that didn't reach his eye.\n\nThe customer didn't say anything, she just grunted as she swiped her car. It was apparently too late/early for her to have energy for interacting with people. She took her cigarettes' with a mumbled thanks and shambled out as she pushed open the door of the convenience store/cross roads.\n\nWith the customer gone Vick sighed and grabbed an energy drink can and cracked it open and taking a sip. He stifled a yawn as he drank, trying to wake up just a bit more. The automatic doors opened to the dark outside and slid close allowing in no one. With a yawn Vick looked down and saw bottle of soda and beef jerky on the counter, Abyssal Cola and Cajun Beef Sticks.\n\nWith a customer service smile he scanned the items for no one, \"that will be </////\\*//>.\" \n\nLooking back down the items were gone and an oily black stone was in it's place. Vick picked up the stone and put the bills in his register. Pulling out the coins and put them on the counter pulling his hand back he looked at the black pebble and said, \"out of <//////\\*>, </\\*///> is your change.\"\n\nThe smaller black stone blinked out of existence and the automatic doors slid open and closed again. With a yawn Vick picked up his can of energy drink again and cracked it open, taking a long drink he looked out into the dark. It was too early/late for him to be awake. It was always too early/late.\n\nWhen was the last time Vick saw the sun?\n\nA man came in through the revolving door wearing tattered pants, scuffed boots, a freshly pressed collared shirt and a too big trench coat. He was bald and pale with eyes and mouth too big and a nose and ears too small. He came straight to the counter and pointed at the shelves behind Vick, \"one smoke/stimulant/poison/death, Old Peculiar.\"\n\n\"I'm going to need to see ID for that,\" Vick said as he reach over and grabbed a carton of cigarettes'.\n\nThe man offered a small booklet and Vick took it. Looking at the card Vick noted the date that made the man two million years old. Nodding Vick handed the card back and the man put the booklet into the inside breast pocket of his trench coat. Scanning the cigarettes' he checked the 'old enough' box and said, \"fifty soapstone.\"\n\nThe man nodded and put down five greenish, five pointed coins. Vick picked them up and put the bills into his register with his customer service smile, \"is there anything else I can get for you?\"\n\nThe man hummed and looked at Vick with his too large eyes, slowly blinking. Eventually he asked, \"got a light/ignition/destruction?\"\n\nVick reached under the counter and pulled out a book of matches and handed them to the man.\n\n\"Thank you/appreciated/mercy,\" the man said and left through the revolving door.\n\nVick dropped his smile and picked up his energy drink can and cracked it open and took a long drink. He looked out into the dark that ate the light that left the windows and yawned, it was too early/late for him, he was tired, he wanted to sleep.\n\nWhen was the last time Vick went home?\n\nA kid pushed open the door and darted to the candy isle while a women entered behind him. She gave him an apologetic smile as she fallowed. Her eyes were solid black. The kid came rushing to the counter with her arms full of wiggling candy bars and bags of squirming gummies. Looking up at Vick with empty black eyes and a smile full of black teeth that oozed a green slime.\n\nVick looked towards the man with his customer service smile, he had crows feet around his eyes and was balding, a green slime dripping from the corner of his mouth.\n\n\"Will this be everything?\"\n\nThey nodded in unison and Vick started scanning. As one the two started humming the same tune, the rhythm of the metallic clicks had Vick nodding his head in turn. Once done Vick read out the total, \"twenty one drops of ichor.\"\n\nHe looked up and the woman held her finger to the boy who opened his mouth. Black sharp looking teeth covered in green slime were bared and the woman pricked her fore finger on one. She moved it over the counter and an orange liquid dripped from her finger tip. It landed on the counter with a solid thud and rolled like a marble. After twenty one landed on the counter Vick picked them up and put the bills in the register.\n\nThe man made a wasp like buzzing sound to the girl. The girl looked up and opened her mouth only for a the sound of grasshoppers to come out.\n\n\"Have a good one,\" Vick said as his smile reached his eyes, the child was cute.\n\nAs they left they were momentarily replaced with spider-cricket centaurs between blinks.\n\nVick picked up his can and cracked it open and took a drink. It was too early/late for his liking, he couldn't wait for his brake. What should he get to eat, he wondered, maybe one of those hotdogs on the rotary. He was hungry.\n\nWhen was the last time Vick ate?\n\nLooking back from the window that gave a view into the empty, hungry dark outside Vick saw a cloud of black mist in the rough shape of a person. Vick felt a sensation of falling and landing in a sticky oil. He turned around and got a four nips of vodka, \"usual, \\[-=-\\]?\"\n\nWith a sensation of bugs crawling on his skin Vick nodded and scanned the bottles, clicking the 'old enough' box as he did, \"one memory of a first kiss.\"\n\nVick felt a warm sensation on his lips and in his chest and put the bills in the register, \"nothing else?\"\n\nThe mist evaporated.\n\nWith a sigh Vick picked up his can and cracked it open. Taking a drink he still felt the warm sensation on his lips. He squinted out into the heavy dark as a memory squirmed it's way to the front of his mind. Warm lips on his, the sound of a soft giggle, he opened his eyes and saw light brown ones looking back, she smelled like lavender.\n\nWhat was her name?\n\nThe sound of automatic doors that let in no one broke him from his trance and Vick found a bag of chips on the counter with a six pack of beer, \"I'm going to need some ID.\"\n\nThe feeling of static on the back of his neck.\n\n\"I can't sell it to you if you don't have ID,\" Vick shrugged.\n\nA numb feeling in his left foot.\n\n\"That was \\[-=-\\],\" Vick said, \"I've checked his ID hundreds of times. I've never seen you before.\"\n\nHis nose was itchy.\n\n\"ID or put it back.\"\n\nHis eyes burned.\n\nInstead of answering Vick took the beer and put it behind the counter and scanned the chips, \"chips are <//\\*/////>.\"\n\nHis nose was itchy and his eyes burned.\n\n\"Pay for the chips or get out,\" Vick told them.\n\nThe chips disappeared and a black stone and pebble appeared in its place, exact change. The automatic doors opened and closed. Rolling his eyes Vick picked up the stone and pebble and put the bills and coins in the register.\n\nA little more agitated he picked up his can and cracked it open and took a drink while looking out into the featureless dark. It was too early/late. He wanted his shift to be over and go home. Did he drive or walk, he can't remember.\n\nWhere was he?",
        "  \n\n\u201cI love you baby\u201d she murmured to her lover, in a flush of post-coital happiness, and nestled her glowy face against his sweet-smelling neck. Ali held her close, \u201cI love you too\u201d, and they both giggled, delirious with joy. \n\nSo far, everything in this year-long relationship had been wonderful, amazing, incredible. There had been a few, tiny, baby red flags, more pink than red, and weren\u2019t those just family quirks? The fact that his Mom had a key to his apartment and popped in and out was surely normal, as was the frequency with which he mentioned her. After all Mom did most of his housework, right down changing his sheets and doing his laundry. If anything, Lisa envied him and wished her mother, very much of the hands-off school of parenting, was half as engaged and helpful as his Mom.  That was precisely why she found it so odd, she told herself as she thirstily drank in his love and attention- her parents had been distant, and her dad had been dead for more than ten years now, so she really didn\u2019t have a good barometer of what healthy parental relations looked like. Perhaps it was completely normal for mothers to have full knowledge of their forty-two-year-old, fully functioning, self-sufficient son\u2019s eating habits and sleeping schedule, not to mention arranging his car check-ups, medical and bank appointments. She repeated to herself it was probably completely fine and normal, and yet during their weekly committee meetings with her girlfriends where relationships were analysed and action items issued, she somehow forgot to mention these silly quirks. After all, she reasoned with herself, she had to respect his privacy. However, nothing else was out of bounds in those crucial meetings- minutiae of their conversations and sexual life was enthusiastically placed under a microscope. Just not his relationship with his Mom. \n\nEventually they rolled away from each other. It was still early, although getting dark outside- a beautifully mild fall evening. \u201cWanna go grab a drink?\u201d Ali asked. \u201cSure!\u201d she replied, \u201cA beer would go down nicely, after all\u2026 this\u2026\u201d and they both laughed again in fond memory of their recent bedroom romps. \n\nThe local watering-hole was a barely a ten-minute walk away. They held hands like those disgusting couples doing PDA all the time- hell, though Lisa happily, they were a disgusting PDA couple now, the kind other people rolled their eyes at and muttered \u201cget a room already\u201d. The twilight autumn sky was a deep navy-blue, and the smell of damp orange leaves filled the air. Ali lived in a quiet neighbourhood and there weren\u2019t many people out. A woman was walking towards them on the pavement, her face shadowed. She was backlit by the streetlights, and her short grey fluffy hair shone like a halo around her dark face. For a minute Lisa thought, but how could it be? His Mom didn\u2019t live close by and there was no reason for her to be out on a damp fall evening a street away from Ali\u2019s place- anyway she could be mistaken- she had only met his Mom a few times during the past year- a perfectly cordial, lovely woman.  \n\nThe haloed woman was drawing closer to them, and Lisa could swear it was his Mom. She glanced at Ali, but he was babbling something about neo-colonialism and US politics, and he betrayed no interest or recognition in the approaching woman. A wave of fear broke over Lisa, as she realised she would have to pass the woman, and she had a sudden, irrational urge to move to Ali\u2019s other side, but he was gripping her hand very tightly and striding along, and she didn\u2019t see how could do that in a normal-seeming manner. She didn\u2019t like to interrupt him as he was talking so enthusiastically, and anyway sometimes he didn\u2019t hear her when she tried. The street lamps were now glinting on the older woman\u2019s eyes barely two steps away from her, and Lisa was sure it was his Mom, bearing down on her. Lisa\u2019s heart was beating so fast she felt it would burst out of her chest. The woman smiled at them, her teeth shining.\n\n\u201cThere you two are! I figured it\u2019s such a nice evening that you\u2019re bound to go out and I thought I\u2019d pop in and do the bed while you\u2019re gone! Lisa\u2019s not going back with you, are you my dear?\u201d and her teeth gleamed at Lisa. \n\nAli bent down and kissed his Mom, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, Mom!\u201d he grumbled. Lisa stood by, unable to speak. This is normal, she told herself frantically in a vain attempt to steady her galloping heart. This is completely normal.",

Thresh knew very well exactly how soft his own scales were compared to the old quartermaster. Husk\u2019s scales had grown opaque long before Thresh was hatched. Moreover, the old Gathering had dedicated himself to his calling of providing for the adventurous and the youthful spirited. Added to all of that, Quartermaster Husk had been on one of the few ships that had encountered humans in the first days of their contact with the galaxy at large and had been in near constant contact with them since. It would have been stone-brained for any commander to just dismiss the quartermaster\u2019s concerns, let alone a commander as new as Thresh was.\n\nStill, it was clear that the older Gathering was by natural disposition \u2014 a disposition that had been strongly tempered by the experience of those first chaotic days of contact with the humans \u2014 far more than overly cautious. Therefore, Commander Thresh listened intently to the long list of minor safety infractions that the current human population of the base had incurred over their stay.\n\n\u201cThey are simply going to\u2026 what is the word they use\u2026 \u2018upcycle\u2019 some expired equipment?\u201d Commander Thresh glanced at the proposal. \u201cIt is considered safety equipment at that. There is nothing toxic or dangerous, and every human is rated to safely dispose of pressurized containers. Added to this, they proposed a slow, gradual release of pressure. They are also requesting the activation of every cleaning drone in preparation. It seems that every safety and hygienic measure is being proactively taken.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen there is their scent when they talk about it,\u201d Quartermaster Husk said after a particularly slow and contemplative blink. His tongue flicked out as if trying to recapture the memory of the smell. \u201cThe smell is so very similar to the smell they give off when anticipating danger,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cnot exactly the same scent here\u2026 but very, very close. I simply do not think that it would be safe to let this idea sprout.\u201d\n\nCommander Thresh hummed thoughtfully as he deliberately mulled over the arguments. It clearly wasn\u2019t enough to forbid a morale-boosting safety training exercise that everyone was so obviously willing to participate in. Clearly Quartermaster Husk understood this as well; the dejected slump of his shoulders showed that clearly enough. It also showed that he clung to his theory that the training session was going to go horribly wrong in some unscentable way.\n\nThe commander drew in a deep breath and bobbed his head firmly. \u201cAuthorize the session on my word and note your objections as clearly as you are able,\u201d he said.\n\nQuartermaster Husk flicked his tongue out in obedience. Having the decision made clearly relaxed him, but he still looked uneasy.\n\n\u201cWe will at the very least get good data on our newest allies out of it,\u201d Commander Thresh said with a comforting wave of his tail. \u201cNow I have to go inspect the outlying bases for predator safety. Hopefully the exercise will still be going on when I return, and you can detail your concerns then with the aid of active observation.\u201d\n\nQuartermaster Husk gave a noncommittal grumble, and Commander Thresh scrambled briskly away to his transport. The predator inspection left him as uneasy as ever. Not at the sight of any predator but at the clearly murderous contraptions the humans insisted were basic predator defense. Granted, they had not lost a single ranger to predation since they had implemented the humans\u2019 tactics, but the buzzing of the electric fence alone was enough to set his scales tingling with empathetic stress for any poor creature that touched it. He arrived back at the base far later than he had expected and was pleasantly surprised to find that the indicator lights showed the exercise was indeed still in progress.\n\n\u201cCurious,\u201d he muttered as he approached the main airlock.\n\nThe ground outside the airlock was dusted with a fine white powder, and signs of freeze burns tinged the ground cover that had been healthy when he had left. His tongue scented that the dust was fire retardant. He grimaced in annoyance. How had the humans gotten waste product so far outside of the disposal area? He supposed the old quartermaster would be more than glad to fill him in. He ambled through the airlock and immediately noted the cacophonous noise from the far side. The airlock floor was covered in chemical fire retardant interrupted with broad swaths that looked like the cleaning drones had tried to remove it and had only marginally succeeded, and the air was stale with extra carbon dioxide.\n\n\u201cLife support!\u201d the commander snapped out. \u201cGive me a carbon dioxide reading!\u201d\n\nThe system exhausted a chemical profile for a fully safe and clear, but it was overlapped with an indicator that the systems were having to overclock to maintain that state. The commander rushed through the final lock and froze as he looked out onto chaos. Before he could begin to process what he was seeing, a warm pair of hands scooped him up from under his forelimbs and deposited him under one of the benches the humans sat on to make putting on their foot gear easier.\n\n\u201cSafer under here, sir!\u201d Assistant Quartermaster Smythe said with a sigh before sitting back down on the bench above them.\n\nCommander Thresh was vaguely aware that Quartermaster Husk was grumbling something beside him. It was no doubt some variation of having told him so, but the chaos that had taken his base was consuming the commander\u2019s attention.\n\nAll obstructions had been moved out of the main hallway, and the cargo doors had been thrown open. Someone had painted guide tracks seemingly randomly across the floor, and what seemed like every disc-shaped cleaning drone had been set loose in a sea of chemical fire retardant. Which might have made some level of sense, he supposed. Except someone had gone to great lengths to set controlled fires alight on top of each and every drone. Dashing through this chaos, humans \u2014 more humans than he thought his base contained \u2014 perched in pairs and singly on the office chairs meant for their use and on the mobile benches meant for the use of the lower bodied Gathering. The humans appeared to be using the expired fire extinguishers as propulsion, explaining the sea of retardant that covered the floor. When a human managed to get near a flaming cleaning drone, they would aim the extinguisher at the flame and hold it there until the propulsion of the escaping gas or chemicals pushed them away. The second human used an extinguisher in the opposite direction to counter, but without apparent synchronization, it seemed difficult to manage.\n\n\u201cAre they practicing putting fires out in zero gravity conditions?\u201d the commander finally managed to gasp out, hoping that he sounded like a reasonable adult rather than the sun-stunned hatchling he felt like.\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Quartermaster Husk grunted out as he rubbed his nose against a thigh to wipe off some retardant.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Commander Thresh said with a tone of forced cheerfulness, \u201call the fires are nearly out, so this should be over soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cTakes them maybe two minutes to put the fires out,\u201d Quartermaster Husk snapped.\n\n\u201cThen how are they still\u2014\u201d Commander Thresh began.\n\nHis question was interrupted as an extinguished cleaning drone rolled past them, busily sucking up retardant. One of the single humans on an office chair rolled past and with a whoop of glee sent a gout of flame pouring into the dish taped to the drone\u2019s top. The flame seemed to come from an improvised device. The fireproof drone continued on its way dutifully with a fresh pillar of fire leaping from its dish. Delighted hoots from the paired humans followed as they tried to aim for the newly lit drone.\n\n\u201cWhat could go wrong?\u201d Quartermaster Husk demanded in a grim tone.\n\n\u201cI begin to understand why my human colleagues fear that question,\u201d Commander Thresh murmured.\n\n# [Humans are Weird \u2013 Upcycling - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/Dq4WnbAFAr8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBook 1 \"[\u200b](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)Humans are Weird: I Have the Data\"\n\n[Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RSVHL81)\n\n[Barnes & Nobe (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/humans-are-weird-adelia-gibadullina/1138927933;jsessionid=CED1CA2DD868CAE60C7F4EAC8FEDD5E5.prodny_store01-atgap01?ean=9781736003923)\n\n[Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=USta%20eBook%20by%20Betty%20Adams%20-%201230004645337%20%7C%20Rakuten%20Kobo%20United%20States)\n\n[Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# [Humans are Weird: We Took A Vote BOOK 2 | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)",
        "As soon as he set foot inside the office the casual chatter died away. A synchronous tapping of keyboards and the occasional click of the mouse resonated in the room.\n\nEveryone in this room had an aura. An aura of an unwavering heart, an unmovable sense of justice, and a burning passion to cleanse everything that was impure. These were the things that their employers looked for when they were at the interviewing panel. Anyone in this room however would agree that all of their aura combined would pale in comparison to Mr. Guan. He was the chief inspector of this unit after all.\n\nHis solemn steps echoed off the tiled floor and retreated behind his personal office door. A glimpse of a sizable calligraphy banner with the words \u201cgu\u0101ngm\u00edngzh\u00e8ngd\u00e0\u201d, \u201cupright and righteous\u201d could be caught just before the door shut tight. The door\u2019s sound insulation was pretty good. There was no way to tell whether the chattering outside started again. Not that Guan cared, as long as they did their job right.\n\nWhat matters most to Guan was his duty and today was another day to fulfill it. The Great Firewall of China might be up to fend the Chinese people from impure Western influences, but there was still a lot of work to purge immoral sites from within. A few clicks of his mouse brought Guan to the sketchiest sites the Chinese internet had to offer. A video immediately autoplayed as he tried to scroll down. Tones of bright oranges and purple shone off his spectacle lenses behind the screen. A woman\u2019s voice way too familiar echoed from his computer\u2019s speakers, \u201cMacao\u2019s top casino is online! Crown Mac-\u201d With a click of another button, the site died in an instant, along with the announcer\u2019s voice. Another pest got rid of. Still, there was much more to cover.\n\nAnything that had seen the light of day or moonlight, Guan had already dealt with in the last 30 years of his career. These degenerates out there had no sense of decency and he was determined to smite their works online out of existence. Guan took a sigh. With the birth rate dropping ever so sharply, if only these nefarious creatures transfer that willpower of posting videos of people having sex into actually meeting women and building families of their own, the country would be in a more glorious state.\n\nThe mail icon on his screen just vibrated with a \u201c+1\u201d notification bubble. Opening the email revealed a request to give this lecherous picture of a lady with a more modest presentation. Using his smart tool on his image editor, with a click and drag of the mouse, Guan quickly managed to deduce the distance between the lowest point of the lady\u2019s blouse to the spot between her collar bones. This would have been fine a couple of years ago, there was no sign of any cleavage at all. But after some revision in protocol, any blouse that was 2cm beneath the collar bones was definitely too erotic. And it seemed like this was the case for this photo. Quickly switching to a warp tool, Guan managed to give this pornographic image a state-approved modification. He quickly attached his work to the email\u2019s reply and clicked on the next tab of his web browser.\n\nThe room exploded with the moans of a woman near climax. Guan just muted his speakers without any emotions even seeping through his iron mask of a face. One would think that this obscene amount of pornography floating out there would get people riled up, go break some beds and maybe get a visit or two from the stork. Of course, this was not the case. If it was anyone, Guan knew it the most. Every day when he screened thousands of sites, he would sit there emotionless and definitely not a single hint of interest. It did not help that with his department and many others in the country like his sterilizing the entire internet, even a single item deemed to be risque would be censored out of existence. After all, having anything so obscene in a public space was not socially acceptable. Guan was sure he did a good job to not let that happen.\n\nHe glanced at a photo of a teenage boy on his desk and he shook his head instinctively. Perhaps he did too good of a job. Guan always gave the impression that he was a strict supervisor. The mentality did not stray far at home either. His boy at home was made into a fine gentleman through his draconian upbringing. He should be proud, but whenever he saw him it always felt like a shard of glass being shoved into his heart since that day.\n\nGuan dragged his son Er-Ge to the restaurant. A young, pretty lady was sitting inside, occasionally glancing up from her phone, as if looking for someone. Er-Ge was reluctant to enter, his whole body contorting away from the restaurant.\n\n\u201cLook, I know you\u2019re not a fan of this. But just meet Caihua, okay? I know her father from work. She\u2019s a nice, decent young woman, and who knows, maybe when you meet her something might happen. Just have lunch with her. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d\n\nEr-Ge turned away. \u201cI don\u2019t want to meet girls,\u201d he muttered.\n\nGuan walked around to meet his gaze. \u201cYou have to, if you want to get married and have kids. And you have to. Your mother and I have been waiting a long time, 35 years. We just couldn\u2019t wait anymore.\u201d\n\nEr-Ge looked away again. \u201cI want neither of those things. You know that very well.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just shy. She\u2019s a lovely girl, you\u2019ll grow to like her!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m perfectly fine by myself, thanks very much. I don\u2019t need a\u2026 A girl, to spend my time with her or whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just frustrated. Maybe you would benefit from\u2026 A woman\u2019s touch, shall we say.\u201d\n\nEr-Ge blushed bright red. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s a disgusting thing to say. I don\u2019t need that, I certainly won\u2019t do\u2026 The thing necessary to make babies. I\u2019m not getting married, I\u2019m not having\u2026\u201d He looked around, before adding in a low whisper, \u201cHaving sex. That is horrifying. No. I\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\nGuan grasped his son\u2019s hand tightly, to stop him from leaving. But with a quick fling of the wrist, Er-Ge broke free and darted into the crowd. Guan sighed in anguish, and leaned against the glass walls of the restaurant for support, slowly sliding to a sitting position on the dusty pavement.\n\nTaking a deep breath, the familiar office returned to him. He looked deep into Er-Ge's face. All those years of indoctrination that sex being a perverted act that should be shamed upon backfired on Guan at a personal level. The dreams of having a large family and continuing the family bloodline were bleak. His son would never find a girlfriend and getting married was out of the question.  He was getting old and there was nothing he could do about it. The ruminations brought Guan to sniffle, as he tried hard to suppress these emotions he had been trying to hide all the time. A warm teardrop trickled down his cheek. All he wanted was just a grandchild. Was it too hard to ask for that? \n\n\\----\n\nFor more like this, please visit our sub r/RedTideStories or our blog on [64fd.wordpress.com](https://64fd.wordpress.com).",
        "Let me start by saying this is just a rant not meant to be directed towards any specific person/people/group. I will also start with some background from just before everything went to hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack in December 2019 I had come down with a fairly nasty illness. Now I'm not one who gets sick very often so when I do I usually get the worst of it. I normally don't call out from work so I decided to go to work anyway. My symptoms were as follows shortness of breath, clogged sinuses, aches and pains, and vertigo. The vertigo was the most concerning and driving across town probably wasn't my best idea but sometimes I make bad choices. I lasted maybe an hour at work before my boss told me to go home and not to come back without a doctors note. I drove home carefully as my vertigo had gotten worse and woke up my then girlfriend. Since it was her day off I had to take me to urgent care to get checked out as I had never felt this bad before. \n\nOf course urgent care didn't do a damn thing for me other than tell me I was sick prescribed some meds and told me to get some rest. I called my boss from the car ride home and told him what they said and sent him a picture of my note that gave me the next couple days off. I slept most of the rest of the day while my GF went to work. The next morning she wasn't feeling great either which we both kind of figured would happen but she decided to go to work anyway and I told her to take my truck as there was snow on the ground and she didn't have four wheel drive. She had the late shift so I knew she wouldn't be off until 10:30pm. Around 7:30 I woke up and was have some serious issues breathing and heard a loud wheezing sound when I would take deep breaths. I texted my GF and told her I was going back to urgent care with her car so if I wasn't home when she got there she shouldn't worry. I dragged myself to the 24 hour urgent care and waited about an hour to seen by someone. When I finally saw a doctors he did all the normal stuff but when he was checking my lungs he got a weird look on his face. He told me I might have pneumonia and to go to the emergency room as they didnt have an x-ray tech that night. \n\nI texted my GF to let her know where I was going and then I called my mom as I had no idea what do to. She said shed meet me at the ER and we could go from there. So longer story short the ER ran all their tests including a flu test as it was flu season. When the doctor came back in his exact words were and I quote \"You don't have pneumonia but you have some type of flu we have no idea what it is\" Great awesome exactly what you want to hear from the doctors. Anyway they ended up giving my some steroids to help me breath gave me the next week off of work and sent me home. GF ended up getting what I had and we both spent 2 weeks in bed trying to take care of each other. Luckily she didn't have the breathing problems I did but we both made full recoveries. \n\nFast forward to February 2020 when we start hearing about a new virus going around that has the same symptoms we had back in December that's very deadly to certain people and well you all know whats going on with that. So anyway March comes and the whole country is basically shut down aside from essential workers. Hey I happen to be one of those awesome I can keep making money to pay bills and what not. My company then wisely decided to lay off half it staff because they are expecting a huge slow down in the automotive world. and they were correct. The rest of March was slow but with a half staff it was manageable April was more of the same. Then May hits and what do you know we are breaking sales records like crazy and when I say breaking records I mean 40%-50% over the previous year. Since people have time to work on their projects it get absolutely crazy and we are running a crew of 5  for 16 hours a day 7 days a week and it was absolutely exhausting and to top it all off the company has implemented a hiring freeze. So to sum up a lot of the country isn't working, we are short staffed and more busy then we have ever been annnnnd we cant hire anyone new to help us out. \n\nA few months pass and they company is \"helping\" by giving us small bonuses here and there for all our \"hard work and dedication\" after a while they finally give up on the hiring freeze and start letting us get some new people in to help out. I think that only happened because of the immense back lash from stores from being short staffed and the immense amount of overtime they were paying most of us. As for the salary members of our team I can only imagine how much stress they had working 11 to 12 hour days without any compensation other than a pat on the back from upper senior management. Now I will be straight with you all I love working some overtime here and there but after a while I'm over it and just want some time at home with loved ones. Working as much as I did sent me into a depression where I was eating a lot drinking even more and pushing loved ones away from me and when they tried to help I would push them away and come up with all sorts of excuses for my actions. It wasn't just the job that caused this it was the inability to go out and do normal stuff without all these extra steps and masks and you all know and I lost myself. If it wasn't obvious this pandemic cost me my relationship and a lot of my own sanity to the point where I gave my boss 12 hours notice that I was hopping on a plane across the country and Id be back in a week. I needed to get away clear my head or I probably wouldn't be here typing this all out right now. \n\nFor the most part things are sort of back to before the pandemic, We have more staff while sales are still up about 15% over record setting numbers from last year. But what really really still irritates me is people still coming in happy about the fact they didn't have to work for an entire year. I can understand that being stuck as home was a different kind of hell but being stuck at work 6 days a week working 11-12 hour days and generally getting our asses kicked every day was something else. Now here we are almost to 2022 and we are still having problems finding people to work for smaller wages because the cost of everything has sky rocketed and companies cant increase wages partly due to cost of goods. Its crazy to think just  2 years ago I could go rent a 2 bedroom apartment for $1000 and now its nearly triple because of all the money lost from the eviction memorandum. Anyway thats all I have for now.",
        "When I was little I had this weird dream of my sister learning how to drive but then she crashed into a wall. There was a hole and that hole lead to peppa pig.

        "Tw: implied death\n\nThe rain patters against the window. It doesn\u2019t wake anyone in the house, it only allows them to dream of more peaceful things. It allows them to dream of joyous things that I could never even imagine. The house is quiet, it always is at night, but this night feels especially quiet. If you were to listen closely, you would be able to hear the light snores coming from the room two doors down.\n\nHe stares out the window, being the only one who sleep has chosen not to bless. The moon shines brightly, reminding him of something he has only seen in his dreams. He turns away from the window, to look at the source of light that permeates his room. The source is the now open door.\n\nA woman stands in the doorway, the light being cast making her seem ethereal. She walks to the boy and sits slightly away from him, reminding him of the fractured relationship they share. The boy tries to speak, but no words make themselves known. Everything that would be said, had been earlier that day in shouts and screams. The boy looks away from the woman and back to the window. The reflection of the light moves towards the sky then vanishes out the door.\n\nHe looks up to the moon, his only source of light anymore. The boy sighs. Purple orchids sit on the tree outside his window. The same flowers he had given to the woman the same morning to show her that he appreciated her.\n\nWetness on his cheeks makes itself known to him. His hand shakily raises to his face. Bitter, salty tears flow freely down his face. He doesn\u2019t let a sob escape him, lest the woman, his mother, return to his room. He couldn\u2019t bear to know his mother knew he was weak for crying. He stands and opens the window. He reaches towards the window, so he may grab one last orchid. He grasps the branch, then tears an orchid away. The boy stumbles, the rain made the windowsill slippery. \n\nA shadow appears in the moonlight, an apparition. It\u2019s a boy around his age. The boy smiles warmly at the other. The boy reaches his hand to the weeping boy. The boy takes the other\u2019s hand as to not fall to his certain death. As soon as he grabs the mysterious boy\u2019s hand, warmth and comfort spread throughout the boy\u2019s body. For the first time in a long time, the boy feels joy. \n\nThe boy climbs to the soaked roof and sits next to the warm boy. The warm boy asks a single question, \u201cWould you like to come to a place where you will never be cold or alone?\u201d\n\nThe boy nods with one single beat of hesitation. As soon as he nods, warmth floods through his veins. All his sorrow is gone and he smiles into the sky, which is blooming into a sunrise. The boy lets go of the other\u2019s hand. The boy holding the orchid floats upwards, then bursts into shiny, golden dust. \n\nThe second boy looks down towards the ground. The orchid the boy had grabbed floats down, guided by the morning breeze. The remaining boy looks back up into the sun as a single tear falls down his face. A scream is heard around the entire house, followed by another tear from the boy sitting on the roof. Without a single word, he leaves.",
        "Tw: Blood, death, implied abuse\n\nI came into this world the way we all have. Crying. It was dark, then a bright, blinding, artificial light burst my world to true life. I could hear crying all around me, and that\u2019s what frightened me. At least, I thought it was crying. I later learned it was doctors rushing around, and pleading with my father not to leave. Yet he did. My mother left soon after him. So I was alone, my first moments of life.\n\nI was taken away, to a home I\u2019ve never wanted to escape more. But, when I was five, I met you. You found me when I was crying in the rain after having been thrown out for something that had irked the matrons. You were with your sister, I believe. She kept calling you to come back, that you would catch a cold, but you stayed by my side until she came over.\n\nI was clothed in nothing but a long white shirt and black shorts that barely came to my knees. She saw that and gave me her coat. She went into the orphanage. You stayed and told me your name. You were a blond, and you had striking golden eyes. I loved them almost instantly. Your neighbor adopted me. We went to school together. We would go down to the pond to see the blooming flowers. We sat in the city gardens. \n\nYou picked up a flower, looked at it for a while, and then looked at me. My mind was elsewhere. I had a sketchbook. I didn\u2019t let you see, but I was drawing you. You reached over and put that flower in my messy black curls. I could feel my face heat up. I turned towards you. You smiled. Your smile\u2026 God, I could go on for ages describing that smile. It was big and bright as if you had experienced no sorrow in your life. It was almost as if you were the sunshine I had been lacking my entire existence. I made myself a promise at that very moment. I would always protect your smile. No matter what happens to me. I would protect you.\n\nWe became friends. Then the war started. As soon as we turned eighteen, we were drafted into the army. It was a long battle for most, or so I heard. For us, it was cut short by a cannon blast and a gunshot. It should have been me that it hit, and you should have lived. You pushed me out of the way. The blast sent you back into a tree. Your legs were gone, and even I, who had no medical training before, knew that you were not long for this world.\n\nI ran as fast as my legs could humanely carry me. You saw me. I drew your attention away from the blood, of which you had always had an innate fear. Your golden eyes met my dull blue ones. You spoke, your voice was shaking horribly. \u201cWhere are my legs?\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t bear to answer you. So I didn\u2019t. \u201cJust keep your eyes on me. You will be okay.\u201d\n\nI lied to you. I couldn\u2019t bear to face the truth. You stared deep into my eyes. I could tell the sunshine I clung so hard to was fading. You then smiled. I was shocked, why were you smiling while dying so young? You smiled because I was there. You said, \u201cYour eyes are beautiful, everything about you is beautiful. I have loved you since we met.\u201d\n\nThen my sunshine was gone. Your eyes closed and your breathing stopped. I screamed. I screamed your name so loud, an enemy gunner found me. He didn\u2019t know I was part of his enemy. He told me to turn around. I was blinded by pain, despair, and rage. I grabbed the gun by my side and bashed the enemy gunner over the head with it. It broke. He fell. I picked up his gun and beat him until his head was nothing but a pile of mush under my boots.\n\nA single gunshot and the sudden numbness spreading throughout my veins quickly told me someone had seen my act of senseless revenge. I fell to my knees. Another shot was fired through my chest. I was kicked in the side. I fell. As I bled to death, I stared at your face. My sunshine was no more, and I, the moon, would follow wherever you were destined to go. My eyes closed.\n\nMy introduction to the next life was almost the same. I suppose I was destined to suffer fate\u2019s wrath. I don\u2019t much care to recall the events that took place, as they were almost the same, if not worse than the events of my past life. I suppose the only reason I made it through each day was the picture I drew of you from my memory. To truly represent the true beauty that you were, I hanged your picture up in front of my window, so the sun shone through it. \n\nBut I met you when I was fourteen and you were fifteen. Your hair was the same gold as the sun, just like our past life. Your eyes were the sun to me, the only light I ever needed. I wanted to reach out to you, to be a part of your life again. But you pushed me away. My sunshine was being snuffed out by the people around you.\n\nWe ended up in the same place. The second war of sorts. It was a magical guild. You took me into your group, along with two others. You believed we were strong, even though I knew I shouldn\u2019t be compared to you.\n\nSo now as I lay here, reflecting on everything, as you watch me fall to my knees, then get kicked onto my back, I have no regrets. I am and always have been willing to die for you. You scream my name, my true name. I can feel a smile reach my tear-soaked face. You break away from the captors and rush to catch me in vain. You stare down at me the same way I had stared at you that lifetime ago. My eyes feel heavy. I let them fall closed. You scream those same words I told you a lifetime ago. You say that final sentence you told me in our past life. \u201cI have loved you since we met.\u201d\n\nLady fate is a cruel, yet beautiful woman. I would have loved her if it weren\u2019t for you. We couldn\u2019t be together in our past life, nor your current one. I watch as you lash out as I had done. Lady fate watches with me. You complete the thing I couldn\u2019t in our past life. You defeat them and continue living. You scream into the open air, just as I had done. I know you wished you had lost, but you couldn\u2019t. Not when you had spent so long becoming stronger to keep that promise you made me and our other two friends.\n\nBefore I pass on, I want you to know I heard you when you said that you would wait for me. I will wait for you as well. I don\u2019t know when we will meet again, but I promise you, as your faithful moon, I will make sure we meet again, my sunshine.",

        "So when i was in 2nd grade, i hated this one girl. Lets call her Mary. She was mean and annoying. So i was next to a friend, and lets call her Isabelle. We were all downstairs where the playground was. So i whispered to Isabelle and told her Im going to throw a rock, and i don\u2019t think she heard me. I threw a rock at Mary and it hit the back of her neck. It was a tiny little pebble. She started yelling at Isabelle telling her not to throw a rock at her. She got up and told a teacher, and said that she saw Isabelle throw a rock. All 3 of is were in the same class. The teacher downstairs told our teacher. Isabelle and Mary were sitting down at a table with the table with our teacher, and i heard everything they were saying because my desk was next to that table. The teacher asked Mary if she was sure she saw Isabelle throw that rock, and she said no but she saw a black sleeve. Me, Isabelle, and some other girl next to me were wearing black sleeves. So my teacher called me over and asked me what happened and i was too scared to tell her i did it, so i said i didn\u2019t see anything but a girl from another class had a black sleeve and was sitting near us. The teacher called her in from the other class and interrogated her too. Eventually, nothing happened and i don\u2019t think anybody found out.",

        "I was at home the other day when I felt that urgent need to take care of my bodily needs, the problem was that I am a shy shitter, I don't like to do it when other people (that I know, just to clarify) can listen to me doing my business.\n\nMy problem was that in my house privacy is almost non-existing.

        " \n\n10th Grade can be a huge pain in the asshole.\n\nI hat to be one of the 'back in my day' people, considering at the time of this writing I'm only fifteen, but kids these days don't have to deal with eldritch monsters and shit. Unfortunately, I did have to. On that one Wednesday afternoon, during English class, the loudspeakers came on, and the vice principal's panicked voice flooded the room.\n\n\"Lockdown, Lockdown, Lockdown, *Lockdown,*\"\n\nUsually, we could tell if a lockdown was the real deal because, in a drill, the vice-principal or the principal says 'lockdown' three times (obviously). But when a lockdown is real, and when someone dangerous and armed is in the building, the vice principal says 'lockdown' four times, and that's when shit gets real.\n\nThe lockdown was going smoothly at first until we realized something. A girl, the basic dumb white blonde bitch, Linda, was in the washroom, and she hadn't gone back for ten minutes since the lockdown started. Our seven-foot-five, 300 pound English teacher built like Shaq O'Neal bravely volunteered to go check if everything was okay. Honestly, I didn't think a bullet could even pierce his skin enough to reach his vital organs. When the teacher hadn't returned in twenty minutes, we started to panic.\n\n\"What the hell is going on? They should be back!\" One kid said.\n\n\"They're probably dead,\"\n\n\"The fuck?\"\n\n\"When is this over?\"\n\n\"Anybody have some weed?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Fuck, I don't have a lighter.\"\n\n\"EVERYBODY SHUT THE FUCK UP!!! We wait ten minutes until Mr. Johnson comes back, and if they don't come back, we-\"\n\nSomebody screamed in the hallway. A female voice, familiarly annoying and reeking of dyed hair and Twitter toxicity.\n\nOne of my best friends, nicknamed 'Blame', pulled me aside from the chaos. Blame was allegedly part of a 'gang' called The Skooters. He dressed in 'hood' clothes, always carried a switchblade and (sometimes) a weak pistol on him, and never spoke in full sentences.\n\n\"Shit's going down?\" Blame asked.\n\nI replied, \"I don't know. Why the fuck isn't Mr. Johnson coming back? Someone is outside, and by the looks of it, they're probably packing serious heat.\"\n\nAnother scream echoed into the hallway. Linda ran down the hallway, like that cliche girl in every slasher film, and she started banging on the door.\n\n\"LET ME IN, LET ME IN!!\" she screamed.\n\n\"Oh hell naw,\" Blame said, flipping her off and walking the other way.\n\n\"Calm down, stop fucking around. What's going on?\" Dan asked, the stereotypical football jock in his purest form.\n\n\"Let me in, something is chasing me!\"\n\n\"This isn't funny, Linda,\" Dan said.\n\nDan slowly removed the barricade and unlocked the door, and he stepped out. Through the window in the door, I could see him asking Linda something when something we couldn't see tripped Linda, and dragged her, screaming.\n\n\"FUCK!!\" Dan screamed.\n\nHe desperately tried to run back to the door, but the thing we couldn't see grabbed him and started dragging him along the floor. He kicked, screamed, and punched, but whatever had a hold of him was much stronger. The two were dragged to the other hallway, where we couldn't see them anymore. The screams eventually cut off.\n\nI rushed to the door, locking it, and I covered the window.\n\n\"THE FUCK IS GOIN' ON, DAWG?!\" Blame screamed.\n\n\"I'm not paid enough for this shit,\" I said. \"And damn bro, stop swearing.\"\n\nAll the testostrone-soaked kids began to panic, and arguments ensued. Three kids, Dan's jocky-ass jock goons, wanted to go out and try to look for him. I tried to argue, saying that it was too dangerous. I almost felt bad for what happened to them when they acted like the absolute meatheads they were and went out.\n\nRyan, one of them, yelled, \"So you're going to just sit here instead of looking for my man?\"\n\n\"Hey, I don't know if you numbskulls can fucking process thoughts anymore, but did you see what took him?! That's no school shooter, hell, it might not even be human. And you want to get out and look for a dead-ass meathead?\"\n\nRyan stepped forward, cracking his knuckles. \"What was that, bitch?\"\n\nBlame, being the six-foot-one, lean, Latino-mixed guy stepped between us and glared at Ryan. \"Dawg, get the fuck away from my homie, or imma fuck your pansy-ass up and make 'ya wish you were never born.\"\n\nRyan, a six-foot-*two* muscular white football player ignored Blame for a second looked like he had an idea. \"You. Give me that switchblade you always carry.\"\n\nIn case you didn't know, even on school grounds, Blame always carried a switchblade in his pocket in case, as he said, 'shit went *down*'.\n\n\"Hell naw, bitch.\"\n\nI decided that I had enough of this shit.\n\n\"You know what? Ryan, if you want to go outside and look for your dead-ass friend, be my guest. No one's stopping you. Go out and fucking die, just know that I warned you.\"\n\nRyan looked hesitant. \"Fine. Let's go!\" he looked at the silent group of high schoolers, then at his jocks. When they didn't come, Ryan went berserk. \"Let's go you freaking pussies!!\"\n\nAnd they went outside, into the dark hallways.\n\nI watched as Ryan and his football gang went, in the hallway where I couldn't see them anymore, which was also the hallway we saw Dan and Linda disappear. I heard their footsteps abruptly stop.\n\nI heard one of them yell, \"What the fuck is that thing?\"\n\nThat was followed by very deep and aggressive growling, and the sound of something heavy standing up.\n\n\"Oh shit, let's dip!!\" Ryan screamed.\n\nturned the mute button on. Then, I heard deep and loud footsteps, then, \"GO, GO, GO-\"\n\nAll the screaming and sounds abruptly cut off, as the sound of something large being dragged down the hallway, heading away from us emenated.\n\nMy stomach twisted. I knew this was going to happen.\n\nEveryone started to panic, a few kids started to cry, and some kids made futile attempts at calling 911, which wasn't working.\n\n\"What the fuck was that?!\" An expendable sophomore asked.\n\nI stood up. \"They're probably dead and fucked, and nothing's going to change that. Now we have... twenty guys? Sorry, I'm not too good at subtraction. Yeah, we have twenty-something people left. We need to at all costs avoid panicking because that'll-\n\n\"Who the fuck put you in charge?\" One kid asked.\n\n\"I did, bruh!!\" Blame said. \"Now shut the fuck up, and listen!\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said to Blame.\n\n\"Anytime, brother.\"\n\n\"Now does anyone have weapons?\" I asked. An unsurprising amount of kids (including me) raised their hands. Of course. Half the fucking class was part of a 'gang'. And we were in the USA.\n\nIn the end, we gathered ten weapons from all the kids. Mostly switchblades, fixed blade knives, folding knives, and even a few combat blades. I had a large folding knife my father, Michael, had given me.\n\nBlame pulled me aside.\n\n\"Yo dawg, I got something to tell you,\" he said.\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'll tell you when you drop the *fucking attitude!!\"* He screamed. \"I have a gun.\"\n\nI raised my eyebrows. \"Are you serious?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yeah, dawg,\" Blame pulled up his hoodie, revealing a nine-millimeter pistol sloppily holstered in his belt. \"I snatched it from one of the security bitches.\"\n\n\"That's great! How much ammo do you have?\" I asked.\n\n\"Two magazines,\" he replied.\n\nI stood up. \"I have an announcement to make. We have a loaded firearm.\"\n\nThe class cheered.\n\nI walked to the other side of the classroom. In case you were wondering, we don't have windows in our classroom, since we're at the heart of the school, and even if we did, we were on the third floor anyway.\n\n\"Now did anyone call the police?\" I asked.\n\n\"Naw, we don't get any damn signal for some reason.\" One kid said.\n\nOf course, they did. I pulled out my phone and typed down everything that had happened on Reddit, so I could post it later or some shit if I got a signal.\n\n\"Should we get ou-\"\n\nMy heart dropped as something huge bashed against the door.\n\nEveryone screamed cuss words and backed away.\n\n\"Oh shit's going down, dawg,\" Blame said. He turned the safety off on his pistol.\n\n\"No,\" I put my hand gently on his pistol. \"Save the ammo for later. I'm going to get a good look at this thing.\"\n\nUpon not hearing any noises, I walked to the door and took the cover off the window. I looked out the hallway and got a long, good look at the thing that had killed five of our classmates.\n\nThere was an actual fucking monster right outside our classroom.",
        "This post explains how three players managed to captivate the trust of 60,000 players, seduce the devs and then build a money printing empire, which then destroyed the in-game economy and forced a reset. \n\n**Top player, few friends**\n\nWe begin by introducing Christia. She had been playing since 2016 and managed to rise to the top. By 2018, she was tired of being betrayed by those who shared her wealth and in-game success. Many of them had played through many bugged moments of the early days - events that allowed them to accumulate insane wealth quickly and effortlessly.\n\nYet, despite those shared moments, little community existed amongst them. They only approached Christia when in need of something and nothing more. This reality sparked an idea within her - a need - that she knew others shared.\n\n**Vision for a community**\n\nNow understanding the game was lacking something, Christia needed a solution and a team.\n\nCue Dion.\n\nHaving played the game for a year, managing to build a humble empire of 40bn, Dion was ready for something new and exciting. Christia discovered his ability to construct amazing discords from his role in another game. She recruited him, offering a 500bn property package and full autonymy over the server. They swiftly began the construction of their vision.\n\nHowever, attracting people proved challenging, and their project was nearing failure.\n\nOne morning, Christia writes, \"F\\*ck, our Discord is flopping. We need more people,\" and her five fellow users agreed. Then, Dion replies with four game-changing words, the four words that altered the fabric of Landlords permanently and brought scandal, ruin and thrill to players worldwide.\n\n\"I might know someone.\"\n\n**A complete team**\n\nWhen Dion met Illustrious\\_m, they connected instantly. They were only a year apart, with Illu being the youngest. What caught his attention, however, was his ability to relate with anyone. He would convince people into doing things they never imagined. His gift could save the failing Discord.\n\nWith his empire of 250M, Illustrious joined the ambitious team, bringing 300 users with him. Christia had successfully assembled her team.\n\n**Devs, Reddit and F\\*cking everything**\n\nThe Discord quickly grew to over 800 active players. The newbies and veterans mingled and exchanged tips and successes. They discussed their personal and gaming lives with ease and surpassed the sh\\*tty Facebook groups that plagued the internet. Christia's vision was a success.\n\nBut she wanted more.\n\nLuckily, that \"more\" fell into her hands. A failing Landlord Tycoon Reddit needed new owners who could grow it beyond its 300 Redditors and bring excitement to its community. Seeing Christia's success, the owner messaged Christia and begged her to take over, promising that it could help boost the Discord server. She accepted the offer.\n\nWith Reddit and Discord under her influence, Christia now had the opportunity to approach the Gods of landlords. The devs. Her influence over the community was enough to lure them into her emails, chats and eventually her team. She was a sounding board for many updates and new game mechanics, and she relayed everything to the community. Christia opened a conversation between the game makers and the customers, allowing everyone to discuss things openly with RG\\_staff members, which improved customer service quality and speed.\n\nShe showed them the community spaces, tickled their greedy mouths with the promise of access to hundreds of customers and gained credibility, influence and resources.\n\nNobody wielded more power than Christia, and it showed.\n\n**Only Gods joke about sin: Around the world in 20mins**\n\nWithin Discord and Reddit, the mod only rooms allowed Christia, Dion and RG\\_staff to converse about various game-related things. They'd provide months of warning about new features and issues, personally deal with Christia's account and pay coins into their accounts - thousands per month.\n\nThe highlight was when one RG\\_ member typed, \"You've been busy today, Christia. You've been around the world in 20mins, haha.\"\n\nShe panicked and made excuses for her GPS spoofing, but they replied with, \"Don't worry, haha. We don't mind you doing it, just slow down.\"\n\nAnd, at that moment, RG\\_ confirmed what we all knew. The top players have different rules. They explained how \"We tell people not to GPS spoof because it ruins the game\" and when asked about banning, \"We only ban certain accounts.\" New accounts?\n\nThis discovery cemented the relationships with the devs. While others feared retribution, some were protected and dwelled in safety.\n\n**Blinded by success**\n\nNow at 1,000 Discord members and over 2,000 Redditors, Dion and Christia were enjoying things. Illustrious\\_M was creating fun content and keeping people happy, the devs loved them, and the game was rapidly growing.\n\nHowever, Illustrious\\_M had begun to change, but they were completely oblivious to his calculated transformation. They had no idea he had begun talking to top players with huge pockets. They had not noticed how indifferent he was to rules and conditions. And, they paid no attention to his new 1.5T property boost. It was unfortunate. If Dion and Christia had noticed these changes in illustrious, they might have been prepared for what happened next.\n\nIt begins when Illustrious receives a message from a player looking to sell his account. Knowing Illustrious had strong connections with various players, he begged him for help.\n\nBefore this moment, Illustrious had never considered selling in-game, plus his account worth under 10bn wasn't an eye-grabber, but here was someone not only wanting to sell their account but claiming to have something valuable. Once he found out what it was, he wanted in.\n\nThis dude was selling 45 states worth 97-155Bn each and wanted out of the game. Illustrious offered him $250 over 24hrs and sold them directly to another player for \u00a31,500. The trick? He convinced the top player to pay \u00a3250 in advance to then acquire all the states.\n\nHe created money.\n\nHooked, he started to leverage his contacts. He would acquire props from players and sell them to his wealthy contacts, essentially acting as a middle-man.\n\nWhat he needed, though, was more customers, and what better than a Discord with 1,000+ active players. He started private messaging many players, advertising his services and whipping up a private following in need of properties. Top players sold their props to illu, who then sold them to various newbies, enriching their sometimes week-old accounts with assets that made over 10bn per day. All without Dion and Christia's knowledge.\n\nUntil one day, he messaged the wrong player.\n\n**Trouble in paradise**\n\nHow do you reply to \"Why is a mod selling properties for real money? Is that allowed?\" When you're unaware it was even happening? Christia and Dion were blindsided by the countless screenshots of secret dealings, advertisements, and conversations flooding the Discord.\n\nThe only thing either of them wrote was \"F\\*ck!\"\n\nWithin hours, they had RG\\_ complaining about the situation, saying it looked unprofessional. Christia was trying to protect Illustrious despite his betrayal, and Dion was silent. It escalated when the scale of the secret selling had been revealed, he had utilised multiple accounts to shift trillions of dollars worth of in-game props, and all top 50 players bought from him.\n\nHe was dangerous and RG\\_ wanted him gone. Permanently.\n\nChristia and Illustrious argued about the future of the Discord, with the latter suggesting they create a haven for honest conversations about cheating and selling. A place where players could decide to learn about the reality of the game.\n\nThe argument ensued for hours until Dion typed two clear commands: \"!Ban [u/Illustrious\\_M](https://www.reddit.com/u/Illustrious_M/).\"\n\nWithin 24hrs, Dion had essentially removed the virus that threatened to destroy the community. He blocked its access and saved the relationship with the devs.\n\nBut, sometimes, Viruses mutate, and this one became Covid-Fucking-19.\n\n**Martyrs make friends**\n\nOutraged by his swift dismissal, Illustrious was seething. The idea of seeing his reputation, hard work and access to quality deals fade, left him vulnerable and ready to quit. He made money, he had fun, why not quit?\n\nThen, he received a message from two players who change his view of landlords forever.\n\nThese two never posted messages on Reddit or Discord, but they had knowledge that would eventually destroy the economy and force an economy reset.\n\nScreenshots and videos flooded their private Discord, some showing how to farm 5,000 coins within minutes and others showing how to bypass wait times. This was a world of exploits and programming, and Illustrious was about to take them mainstream.\n\n**Exploits for Sale**\n\nThese two had discovered how to remove the coin requirement of properties. Essentially making every prop cash-only and they wanted to sell these to anyone that would buy.\n\nIllustrious\\_M could help.\n\nHe called upon old friends and offered the news, and within hours, he had lines of top 200 players buying the knowledge. The group made a killing.\n\nBut they wanted more. They wanted Discord-level access.\n\n**\"The game broke, but at least we're all friends again.\"**\n\nGetting forgiveness wasn't too hard for Illustrious. The threat of being left behind after he revealed what other players had been doing proved too painful for Christia and Dion. In return for a secret unban, they received the greatest empire-building exploit in history and doubled their empire incomes and values overnight.\n\nPlayers paid plenty for access to the exploit, boosting their empires with endless acquisitions of their local cities and states. It was quickly becoming a noticeable movement. Players complained about their cities being acquired overnight, and properties like Disneyland being purchased by new players within hours.\n\nThen came the flood of states on the marketplace. Multiple 97bn properties were dumped and sold by an endless horde of tycoons. Top players now with incomes amounting to 10T per day purchased them swiftly. Bidding insane amounts, and flooding the market with over 1Q in a short amount of time.\n\nThe worst part? The developers weren't seeing the coin sales to match the incredible purchases. Something was wrong. A marketplace flooded with cash and high-value properties, players earning over 10T per day and inflated property prices forced them to act.\n\nWithin 24hrs, they reverted the game to an old saved version. Undoing every purchase in the last 24hrs and patching the exploit. Players were barred from logging in until they could cleanse accounts of wrongfully purchased properties.\n\nIt was too much, too late.\n\nThey were cleansing accounts based on the recent weeks, not months, meaning veteran players remained untouched. Their accounts now earning 10T daily, stood strong as every other account barely kept their incomes above 10bn.\n\nInflation rose as the top 50 dumped trillions to obtain the properties they desired - competition non-existent. They even formed groups where they'd say, \"I'm biding on this,\" to inform others to stay away. They carved up the countries between them and traded based on owned areas.\n\nIt was the beginning of a new era of landlords, one where rules were for everyone but you.",
        "\n\n\n\nEvery time I see a purple stuffed animal, my mind goes into overdrive and I have to start popping my anti-anxiety pills.\n\nI stopped trying to tell people what I had uncovered, because they all look at me as being crazier than I already was.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was the weird hyper girl, who wore thick glasses and was forced to wear a fanny pack by my mother, because girls clothing didn\u2019t come with pockets and she didn\u2019t want me to lose anything.\n\nThough I was odd, I did have that peppy personality that was never turned off, so I have always done good with customer service jobs, as long as it was through the telephone.\n\nKeeping with my odd personality, I was making solo trips to Disney\u2019s Epcot park in the 1990\u2019s, where I loved the concept of self sustainable mixed in with the different cultures in Epcot\u2019s World\u2019s Showcase.\n\nSometimes, I would get a little too excited and approach strangers with an overwhelming zeal about how fascinating Epcot was, where most of the times the strangers would just smile and walk away and I would hear them making fun of me as they walked away.\n\nAt the same time, I fell in love with Epcot, I also fell in love with this purplish dragon caricature called Figment, which the park touted as its mascot.\n\nI became so obsessed, that any janky souvenir that Disney made of Figment, I owned it, where my apartment was littered with all things derived from the dragon creature.\n\nAs crazy as my mother was, she became rightfully concerned about my mental health related to my obsession with Figment, where everyone else would\u2019ve just laughed and said \u201coh that\u2019s just Melissa and she does weird things like that!\u201d\n\nAt the time, I became so brainwashed that I had no idea how obsessed I was with Figment.  In my mind, it was just some harmless hobby where I had to collect all things Figment.\n\nHowever, as a twenty something year adult, I would have the Figment stuffed animal on my lap, while I was talking on my Figment phone, as I wore a Figment shirt with matching pants and I even had Figment socks on.  Even the pen I was using was a made to look like Figment.\n\nMy mother finally put her foot down, when she saw me at the supermarket with a Figment stuffed animal placed in a shopping cart, where a toddler would sit.\n\nI went to see a therapist, who at first thought I just had an obsession with the dragon, like a teenage girl had with Bon Jovi, but as time went on, she realized that something darker and more sinister was going on inside my head.\n\nI remember the therapy sessions clearly, that went like this:\n\n\u201cHow much money do you have left from your last paycheck?\u201d I remembered the therapist asking me.\n\n\u201cNothing!\u201d I had responded.\n\n\u201cWhat did you buy?\u201d\n\n\u201cA few things from this Disney catalog.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere they Figment related?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d I responded like there was nothing wrong with buying everything Figment related.\n\n\u201cMelissa, I reached out to one of my colleagues who is really intrigued by your obsession with Figment.  Do you remember the movie \u2018The Exorcist\u2019?\n\n\u201cYes, of course!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have become possessed, like the girl in the movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cPossessed how?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother mentioned to me that you were suspended from your job for telling customers that \u2018they have to go to Epcot.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t believe I got suspended for that!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the reason why I\u2019m trying to make you aware of your obsession and that you have been brainwashed. Your mother feels that your no longer Melissa and she thinks that Disney has infiltrated your brain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if you went to Epcot, then you would fall in love with Figment and everything else as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been to Epcot and I had a good time, but I don\u2019t obsess about the park like you do.  I didn\u2019t even pay attention to Figment when I was there, mostly because I was in my later 30\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that age has anything to do with \u2018falling in love with Figment\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cMelissa, I want you to realize that you just said \u2018fall in love\u2019 with an inanimate object.  Figment is nothing more than a marketing ploy to get you to spend more money on Disney related products.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see it that way!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why your here, to help yourself identify your obsession and the \u2018Disney trance\u2019 that your currently in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because my mother said she would cut me off financially, if I stopped coming to therapy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would happen if your mother cut you off financially?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t be able to build up my Disney collection!\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing back to the girl from The Exorcist movie, you too are possessed, but not by the devil, but rather by Disney.  The fact that you can\u2019t identify this on your own, gives more evidence to my theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever! Are we done yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet, your mother also mentioned that you vandalize  cars and do other things to people who go to Universal Studios instead of the Disney Parks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, then your telling me that your mother just made that up?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause she doesn\u2019t like Figment or Disney.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to get help at an inpatient psychiatric facility.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going and you can\u2019t force me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can have you 302\u2019d, involuntary committed!\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder what evidence?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause your a danger to yourself and others!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow am I a danger to others?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother told me that she came across a letter that you hadn\u2019t sent to Disney World, where you were boasting that you \u2018eliminated\u2019 someone talking down about Disney.  Do you want to explain what \u2018eliminated\u2019 means?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what will happen if your arrested and go to court?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, go ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe courts rarely take into consideration insanity pleas, so if you did something against the law, especially which involved harming someone, then you will rot in prison.  However, if you commit yourself to a psychiatric hospital, then at least the real Melissa will come back out.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I have to tell anyone what, I did?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s up to you, I\u2019m not a cop or a judge.  I\u2019m just here to help you.\u201d\n\nI left the meeting and committed myself to an inpatient psychiatric hospital for a month.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize how deep my obsession with Figment and all things Disney had become until I received intense therapy.\n\nI had become that 80 pound woman, addicted to crack, who begs for money at traffic lights, but instead of crack, my fix was with Disney.\n\nI was really fortunate because I was able to get out of the trance that I was in, without divulging the true extent of the  harm that I had caused to others.\n\nIt\u2019s been several years now since I have become detached from Epcot and Figment.  Figment was actually retired by Disney sometime around 1999, which part of me thinks was related to me, where I really think that someone from the psychiatric hospital had tipped off someone at Epcot, saying that I would cause massive lawsuits if my trance like behavior could be traced back to Disney.\n\nI think there was something intentionally housed inside of Figment that allowed vulnerable people like me to become brainwashed and do things that were out of character for them,  almost like Howard Stern\u2019s \u201cwack pack\u201d followers or like Charles Manson\u2019s followers.\n\nI was just a young 20 something year old female, who wasn\u2019t married and didn\u2019t have any friends, so that\u2019s what made me vulnerable and become possessed by Figment.\n\nDisney was really flourishing, post Figment, then the pandemic hit and Epcot along with all of the other Disney Parks were struggling once they were able to reopen to the public.\n\nInstead of a 20 something year old lonely female, now I\u2019m a 40 something year old lonely female.\n\nI still have my peppy personality, however my brain has found alternative methods of getting high without Disney, which is mostly through stuffing my face with food.\n\nI\u2019ve actually become quite depressed, where I\u2019ve been longing for a sense of purpose in life.\n\nThen I saw an advertisement for Disney+ streaming service, where I figured there couldn\u2019t be any harm in the streaming service, because Figment has  been retired.\n\nSo I went ahead and purchased Disney+, where I binged watched as much as possible about the Disney Parks and on Disney movies.\n\nBesides the feelings of a childish bliss, nothing morbid was going on in my head and I still feel like Melissa.\n\nI finished my customer service job today and decided to watch a special on Disney+ about the 50th anniversary of Disney World\u2019s grand  opening.\n\nThe special focused on Walt Disney and his vision for the creation of Disney World and Epcot Studios.\n\nAbout half way through the special, something delightful happened to my brain, where my head lit up like I snorted 10 grams of cocaine, when I saw  the purple dragon, touted by Disney once again, to commemorate the 50th anniversary.\n\nSome people might get seizures when they experience an array a flickering lights, where my brain was completely fixated on Figment.     Watching that purple dragon, woke something up inside of me that had been dead for the past 20 years, where this was the first time, in a long time, that I didn\u2019t want to stuff my face with sweets and greasy foods.\n\nMy brain was so wired that I didn\u2019t sleep for more than two hours and when I woke up, the first thing I did was look into airfare to go to Epcot.\n\nThe flights were relatively cheap to fly to Orlando, so I booked a flight to leave on Friday night.\n\nPart of me knew what I was doing was wrong, but my brain really wanted that feeling of bliss again.\n\nFriday arrived and after work, I took an Uber to the airport.  \n\nI got to Orlando at 10:00 pm and I stayed at Disney\u2019s Boardwalk Villa\u2019s resort, which is within walking distance to Epcot.\n\nI put my bags in my hotel room and I decided to go for a walk at 11:00 pm towards Epcot.\n\nEpcot was like a magnet to me, where I could feel myself being more and more attracted to the Park as the closer I got to its entrance.\n\nThough the park was closed, I could feel the energy of the Park leeching into my brain.  The only thing that was holding me back from making a mad dash into the Park were about four security guards.\n\nI stood at the entrance of the Park for the next three hours, where the only thing that stopped me from staying longer was the pure exhaustion I was feeling from the flight and the fact that I hadn\u2019t eating anything.\n\nSo I walked back to my hotel room and had a snack and went to bed.\n\nI had such vivid dreams that night about Epcot and Figment, where it was one of the few times that I woke up without feeling like a slug.\n\nI took a quick shower and rushed over to the entrance as quickly as I could.\n\n\u201cGood Morning!\u201d I said to a mother and her young son as I walked towards the Park.\nFollowed by at least 20 other times I awkwardly greeted strangers, as I was experiencing a high from the anticipation of entering the park.\n\nThen within five minutes, I crossed the ticket counter and entered the park.  I couldn\u2019t help but feel regret for allowing myself more than 20 years without having this overwhelming sense of happiness.  It was like, I had tortured myself for no other reason, than my therapist thought that it was in my best interest to cut myself off from Disney.\n\nThe more that I walked through Epcot, the happier I became.\n\nAs I walk closer to the World Discovery area, close to the Test Track ride, I see five other like minded guest, who look and dress like me, huddled around something.\n\nI got closer and closer and there he was, a 50th anniversary commemorative statue of my old purple friend, Figment, doing nothing more than just standing there, like a king on his throne.\n\nI was so overwhelmingly mesmerized, as were the five other people gathered around me.\n\nI felt like I was looking at The Beatles, Elvis, and Jesus, all at the same time.\n\nThere is just something about those big yellow eyes and that purple skin that prevented me from walking away.\n\nThe longer that I stand by Figment, the more I feel myself becoming a disciple of his.\n\nI tried the whole religion thing a few years ago, but it didn\u2019t do anything for me, so I quickly lost interest.\n\nHowever, I had been lost and now I feel saved again, just by looking at Figment\u2019s image.\n\nBefore I knew it, the sun was starting to go down, where I realized that for the last eight hours, I did nothing more than stare at Figment.\n\nI was happy because this was the first time that I hadn\u2019t devoured more than 5000 calories before dinner time in a long time.\n\nEventually, I had to leave because Epcot was closing.\n\nSo I walked back to my resort and got something to eat, then I went to bed.\n\nMy dreams were 100 times more intense than the previous night\u2019s dreams.\n\nI woke up the next morning and felt like a had a real purpose in life, where it felt like I was walking on clouds, even though I had stood for 10 hours straight yesterday, I was feeling no pain in my overweight body.\n\nRight away, I headed for the Figment statue and when I got to my beloved Figment, I bowed my head in reverence for the great joy that I was experiencing.\n\nThe only downfall was that my return flight was leaving Orlando at 4:00 p.m., so I couldn\u2019t stay as long as I did yesterday.\n\nI left the park at 2:00 p.m. with a new purpose on life.  The empty void that I was feeling for the past 20 years had finally been filled.  I knew that I would return to Epcot as soon as I could, so I wasn\u2019t feeling down about leaving for the airport.\n\nI made it to the airport onboard Disney\u2019s Magical Express, where I was singing along to the music that was playing on the bus, like a gospel singer would sing praises to Jesus.\n\nI got on my plane and arrived to my home destination\u2019s airport, within two hours.  I called for an Uber to take me back to my apartment.\n\nThe Uber driver was a thirty something year old male, who picked me up in his Toyota Camry.\n\nThe driver was nice enough to put my bags in the trunk of his car.\n\nThe moment I sat in the back seat of his car, I couldn\u2019t help but boast about how great my experience was at Epcot.\n\n\u201cSo how long did you stay at Disney?\u201d The driver asked me.\n\n\u201cI arrived on Friday night and unfortunately I had to leave today\u201d I replied, then I giggled.\n\n\u201cI was there back in 2019 and I thought the Parks were nothing more than a rip off!\u201d\n\nMy smile quickly turned to a frown as I heard the driver talk down to Disney.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just your personality!\u201d I said in a spiteful manner.\n\nThe driver just ignored my tone and then said \u201cI had a much better time at SeaWorld, where the prices were cheaper  \u2026 \u201c\n\nAs he continued to talk, a dark cloud came over me, where all the happiness that filled my head quickly went away.\n\n\u201cStop talking\u201d I whispered to \nmyself as he either didn\u2019t hear what I said or just ignored what I said.\n\n\u201cUniversal Studios was cheaper and better \u2026\u201d\n\nThat was all I needed to hear before I said \u201ccan you pull over, I don\u2019t feel so good!\u201d\n\nThe second he pulled over into this secluded area, I reached into my purse and pulled out my Figment pen.\n\n\u201cAll I am saying is that there\u2019s so much better things to do in Florida \u2026\u201d\n\nThe anger had taken over me.  I yelled out \u201cyou son of a bitch!\u201d And stabbed him repeatedly in his neck with my Figment pen.\n\nI was in such a rage that I lost count in the amount of times that I stabbed him.\n\nI looked around and saw that the car was stopped by a nearby lake. I got my bags out of the trunk.\n\nThe son of a bitch driver kept on making gurgling sounds,  as I put his car into drive and watched his car roll into the lake.\n\nI started to walk home in this secluded area, while carrying my bags, and within just a few minutes some elderly man was nice enough to drive me home, when he saw me walking on the side of the road.\n\nHe didn\u2019t ask me any questions besides \u201cwhere are you heading?\u201d\n\nHe dropped me off at my apartment and the rest of the night I did nothing more than watch Disney+, as I couldn\u2019t wait until the next time I go back to Epcot.",

        " \n\nGrandmother rose before the sun. She had always been an early riser. Up before dawn, making a pot of tea for her and Grandfather. Then she would sit in her favorite chair and enjoy the quiet of the house. She was never truly awake until after that first cup of tea and as such she rarely spoke before then. But around the time when she finished that cup is when Grandfather would have wandered into the kitchen. \n\n\u201cWhat should we have for breakfast today?\u201d she asked. \u201cEggs and toast with a bit of jam and maybe some fruit as well sounds about right, I think. Grandmother rarely waited for a response as after so many years Grandfather had learned that his wife had a certain kind of sense about breakfast and today would be a busy day. The list of errands had grown long and needed to be pruned down. A bit of extra energy would be needed today. \n\nAs Grandmother bustled about the small kitchen she spoke of the many things going on in the neighborhood. She knew that Grandfather had never really listened to her ramblings, only punctuating her few pauses with an \u201cInteresting\u201d or \u201cIs that right, dear?\u201d or \u201cWell, I never\u201d, but they had always enjoyed each other\u2019s company and Grandmother was comfortable with her routine. \n\nAll the same amid the frying of eggs and toasting of toast Grandmother\u2019s voice rose above it all.\n\n\u201cDid you know that The Millers are moving? They just put up the sign yesterday. It will be strange having new neighbors move in after so many years. Did you know they\u2019ve lived next to us for more than 50 years? Moved in just a year or two after we did. They say they\u2019re headed down to the coast. Going to enjoy the sun and water while they\u2019ve still got a few years left to enjoy it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd little Johnny down the street? Not so little anymore. He\u2019ll be getting married in October. You remember how he used to come rake the leaves for us when he was younger? Such a nice boy. My, how time flies. Found himself a beautiful girl too and just as nice as him. And she\u2019s a good cook as well. She made the casserole that was last night\u2019s dinner. He won the lottery with that one if you ask me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSara\u2019s birthday is coming up soon. Need to remember to find a present while we\u2019re out today. I\u2019d spoil that child rotten if Pam and Richard lived closer. That\u2019s what a Grandmother is for, to dote on her grandchildren. But that\u2019s OK. It means a trip to the post office and that means I get to catch up with Beatrice. See how her and Frank and the kids are getting along.\u201d\n\nAs Grandmother washed the pan and the plate and the bowl she went over the errands for the day. \n\n\u201cSo first to the toy store. Find something big that Sara will love. What do 6-year-olds like anyway? We\u2019ll have the store wrap it up. Then we\u2019ll go to the post office and catch up with Beatrice. Next, I\u2019ve got my hair appointment. How else am I going to stay so beautiful?\u201d Grandmother chuckled. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll spoil myself a little and get my nails done as well. What was that color you always liked? Pray Tell Plum? I\u2019ll have to check with Natasha. She\u2019ll remember. Always said it was so sweet that I\u2019d still get all dolled up for you. How else are we supposed to keep the spark alive? I\u2019d ask her. Then I\u2019d throw in a wink and she\u2019d giggle to the high heavens. Next it\u2019s the market for the groceries. Danny should be there today. He can help me get everything loaded into the car. After that it\u2019s back home for a bit of gardening. The weeds need to be pulled and the roses need a little more attention. You know how they can be sometimes. Then a nice long soak in the tub and I\u2019ll need to put my feet up after. They\u2019re always sore after such a long day. I think I\u2019ll order in tonight. Got all that? Ok, time to head out.\u201d\n\nAs Grandmother reached the door she stopped just for a moment to straighten a wedding picture of her and Grandfather. Faded with time, but glowing with the smiles of two people so in love with each other. \u201cSome days are easier,\u201d Grandmother said to the picture, \u201cother days are much harder. I still miss you...even your snoring if you can believe it. I\u2019d like for you to move on, but if I\u2019m going to be haunted by a ghost then I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s you.\u201d\n\nIn response the light in the kitchen, the one Grandmother had purposefully left on, turned itself off. Grandmother smiled and though she couldn\u2019t see it Grandfather smiled too. \n\n\u201cAll right then. Let\u2019s be off,\u201d she said and they both headed out the door. Like Grandmother had said, it was going to be a busy day.",
        "So there was this one time where in middle school, there was a jelly bean on the floor that had been there for the past about 2 months that the cleaning guy somehow wouldn't find, that jelly bean was eaten by another student, he looked around and somehow didn't notice me, quickly picked it up and put it in his mouth and started chewing.",

        "\"Get out of the car, and keep your hands in the air.\"\n\nI stepped out of the car as the man kept his pistol aimed at me.\n\n\"Good, now stay still.\"\n\nThe next second I felt pain in the back of my head, and then nothingness.\n\nI woke up in what seemed to be a abandoned warehouse, tied to a chair, with three men infront of me.\n\n\"Look who woke up! With how hard Jovan here hit you, I would've thought you'd never wake up.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Isn't it obvious? Our money, that is what we want.\"\n\n\"It was my dad who loaned it from you, I had nothing to do with it!\"\n\n\"Well guess what? Your dad loaned it to pay for your cancer treatment, and he is dead! Its up to you to pay up now, and you failed. We both know what happens now. Jovan, get the bat.\"\n\n\"Come on, just give me a week more, I promise I will get you the money?\"\n\n\"Sorry, but no, we both know that isn't going to happen.\"\n\nAt this point I was shaking in fear, I knew they weren't messing around, and that nobody was going to find me this far out.\n\nAnd thats when I heard it. A screech unlike anything I heard before.\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"Probably just a wild animal, carry on.\"\n\nAs one of the men approached me with a bat the screech was heard once again, this time closer.\n\n\"Jovan, go out and scare away whatever is making that noise.\"\n\nOne of the men then walked outside. What followed were gunshots and yelling, and another screech, this time even closer.\n\n\"Jovan?\"\n\nAnd thats when it entered the warehouse. A small creature resembling a dog, but standing on two legs.\n\nIt had two fangs on its arms, one bloody, presumably from Jovan's blood. Its head resembled that of a bat, despite its body being dog-like. It looked at the two men and screeched once again.\n\nIn response the two men fired at it, and the creature charged them at insane speed, quickly killing one of the men with its fangs.\n\nThe other man, who seemed to be the leader of the trio and was the one who talked to me, wasn't so lucky.\n\nThe creature instead cut off his hand, and slowly started cutting the man up.\n\nI threw up in disgust.\n\nIt then looked at me, as I braced expecting a similar fate.\n\nThe creature instead let out a short screech, this one however was quieter and deeper than the prior ones.\n\nIt then charged at me, but instead of killing me the creature cut the rope that was restraining me, before rushing out of the warehouse, back into the night, dragging the screeching man with it.\n\nI was left paralyzed in fear, just sitting in the chair for a bit, before getting up and finding my car, driving away.\n\nBack at home I did some research, and the closest thing to what I experienced seems to be a creature from Balkan folklore called the Screecher, a angry spirit who had been wronged while alive and now seeks revenge on those responsible.\n\nI guess that in a way dad was looking after me even after his death\n_________________________________________________\n\nFor more of my writing see r/JustADrunkSlavStories",

        "When I was little, my parents treated me right, how normal parents do. But everything started changing a little while ago. It started when my sister got a new haircut. She has bad grades at school and stuff but my parents manage to get her anything. I got a C in scholl and my mom screamed at me, why do I have bad grades, but my sister got 5 Fs from maths this school year and isn't getting yelled at, at all. Today it has escalated. At 9 a.m. I had to get up, which is normal, and parents sent me to go buy some shit. Yet my sister didn't do anything. She had to vacuum the house, yet she didn't. When I don't do the vacuuming or sweeping the floor, I have to pay like $2 to my parents. I did everything in the house today and my parents decided to get HER jewellery and guess what? They didnt get me anything. So am I adopted, or do I just overact?",
        "I just felt like I needed to share this so here I go,I work with this guy named jack and he has always been nice never gets mad and is depressed or quiet most of the time but he has never had that look of caring about anything or even being aware of what\u2019s happening we\u2019ve worked together for two years and he\u2019s changed a lot he was 6\u2019 overweight and shaggy but now hes 6\u20194 I suppose lean is the word but he\u2019s lost the weight  and has clearly defined muscles that u can see without flexing which I thought was very impressive and a few months ago I got diagnosed as a psychopath and he found this interesting and he perked right up when I mentioned it to our colleague and recently I turned 18 him already 18 and a few weeks ago I invited him out drinking as I am very small and no other boys where coming with us on this occasion so just to be safe and after promising to buy him a few drinks he agreed we where out he was being a gentleman non sexual complements learning names etc side hugs the lot then I started flirting w some guy and we went to an alleyway to kiss obviously jack asked and I said I\u2019m ok but when we started to make out he got a bit handsy outside my dress that\u2019s fine but he started to undress me and when I resisted he hit me and grabbed my throat saying things like u don\u2019t say no to me I tried screaming I hit him a few times and I was scared crying and could barely breath then I see jack walking towards me this guy swings at jack who then grabs his arm pulls him closer and swept his leg pulls him onto his front jack holds his arm with both hands kneeling on this guys back then just snapped this guys arm jack didn\u2019t Even flinch the guy passed out jack got up and said that was really easy maybe he\u2019s got a bone deficiency turns to me and goes get dressed picks the guy up walks to the front of the club And goes up to the guys friends who where smoking outside drops him at their feet and says I\u2019m going to call the police do u want to play before I do that one lunges on him and jack just grabs the guys head and smashes it into the floor there was so much blood I was sick then the bouncers came over and jack explained it and restrained the rest of the friends finding pills and powders on them probably date rapes and turns out they had a lookout and josh had beat him up before saving me and I quote got a little bit stabbed which he said while in a ambulance turns out he is a sociopath which I don\u2019t know what it means and he said he won\u2019t fall in love with me no matter how many times I flash or spoil him at work and I don\u2019t know how to repay him although I did get a bit mad about him leaving all my friends which he just ignored I can\u2019t bring myself to mention he\u2019s not interested to my friends who half seem adamant on having his kids",
        "It has been nearly 5 months since Diego Sanchez severed all ties with his unstable coach Joshua Fabia. He still remembers the control, manipulation, and outright physical abuse he received from Fabia. It was late at night, midnight or so, and to keep his physical fitness up, he would go for nightly runs. He had stopped to catch his breath as he had been running nonstop for nearly 10 minutes. He is however rudely interrupted when he hears a very familiar voice behind him. It was *Fabia.*\n\nFabia: Oh, what do we have here? Long time no see old friend.\n\nDiego turns to look but before he can see Fabias face, he is knocked out with a punch to the jaw. Sanchez was knocked out for at least an hour. When he woke up, he found himself in a very familiar area, surrounded by other people who he quickly realized were new fighters/students under Fabia. They had been training with Fabia for the past couple months and were manipulated and indoctrinated by Fabia so he could control them and they would stay loyal to him.\n\nFabia: Hello fighters. It is an honor to have been coaching you for the past 70 days. Today to help us train, we have an old friend who very nicely decided to return. Meet Diego Sanchez. For todays exercise, we will be training on kicks and punches to a human subject and depending on his reaction, you will know how much force to apply in the ring when you face an opponent. Now, follow me.\n\nSanchez: FUCK YO-\n\nBefore he can finish, another punch by Fabia hits Sanchez in the belly. He falls over kneeling winded. Joshua drags Sanchez to a room with punching bags hanging from the ceilings with Fabias students following him. Fabia hooked a winded Sanchez to chains that would holster him up into punching bag position with his feet fixed to a metal bar.\n\nSanchez: You won\u2019t get away with this you bastard!\n\nFabia: Get away with *what?* Helping my students? I don\u2019t think I can understand what you mean by those words Mr. Sanchez. Anyways, I will show you the proper techniques for landing kicks and punches on a fighter when you are in the ring. I want you all to pay attention. *Are we understood?*\n\nAll 12 fighters nod in submission. Fabia walks up to an upside down Sanchez to demonstrate his \u201cskills\u201d to his gym. Sanchez would soon realize the shut he went through when he initially trained with Fabia was nothing compared to the torment he is going through his second time around. It\u2019s gonna get very, *very bad.*",

        " This is the third chapter to my story Must I be the Villainess? You can find the first chapter on my page [r/Abriella\\_Castoda](https://www.reddit.com/r/Abriella_Castoda/). \n\n \n\nBy the next morning I started to plan out my escape from the villainess's ending. I would rather not die again. The first time was painful enough and who knows where I will end up next, if anywhere at all. I wrote down all I remembered from the plot. All I have are the male lead\u2019s names, the female lead's name and the basic plotline of the book until I stopped reading it. Hopefully It\u2019ll be enough to get me through this.\n\nAt this age I have already started to show my terrible behavior and the male leads would have been resentful towards me. Plus, I believe the first male lead is just a common worker in my estate now. The second male lead is the crown prince so I don\u2019t have to worry about him for a while. I look to be about 16 or 17. I would have bullied the First male lead because he refused to follow me around as a knight when I discovered him practicing one afternoon. I thought he was handsome and I wanted him for myself so when he refused I made his life a living hell. Hopefully if I begin to ignore him he will think I\u2019ve given up. \n\nI sent for tea around 12 in the afternoon. I have my plan laid out for the most part and I feel a little more optimistic about my chances for survival. The maid came back but not with the tea.\n\n\u201cMary? Where is the tea?\u201d\n\n\u201cApologies madam but you have a guest on the terrace and he requested the tea be left there instead of brought to you.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh it must be the doctor! He must want me to get a bit of exercise.\u201d I chuckled and began to walk towards the door.\n\n\u201cNo madam. It\u2019s Crown Prince Rainier, the sun of our empire.\u201d She shifts uncomfortably and I freeze.\n\n\u2018What?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I heard you. What I meant was WHY is he here?\u201d I start to feel the panic rising in my chest. I shouldn\u2019t have to deal with the prince until a royal ball. Or any ball he wishes to attend. So why is he HERE out of all times? I am supposed to be AVOIDING the male leads but if they come knocking on my door I can\u2019t just turn them away. Well I can for the first male lead but not for the crown prince. Not without reason! The maid didn\u2019t answer and I didn\u2019t expect her to know. I just paced my room for a moment and asked her \u201cIs this presentable enough to meet the Crown Prince?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes madam\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, lead the way Mary.\u201d We walked along the grand hallways to the terrace where the crown prince was waiting for me. With every step I felt more nauseous. I really don\u2019t want to meet him now. We used to be friends as children until my obsessive behavior over him drove a wedge between us. We haven\u2019t spoken in years. What could he possibly want now? I hesitated outside of the door and glanced at Mary. She wouldn't look me in the eyes. *Haha\u2026 that doesn\u2019t make me feel any better. Am I going to die only a day into this story?* I took a deep breath and knocked on the door. \n\n\u201cEnter.\u201d I hear from inside the room. It\u2019s a deep commanding voice and it sends shivers down my spine. NOT in a good way though. I slowly open the door and step in. He has his back turned to me as he looks out the window to the garden.\n\n\u201cYou called for me, your highness?\u201d My voice waivers ever so slightly at the end. I think it startles him for a moment. He turns to see who it was and he doesn\u2019t hide the disdain on his face.\n\n\u201cYou can stop the act, we both know you\u2019re not the timid kind.\u201d He doesn\u2019t turn back to the window but he sits at the table cluttered with tea cups, kettles, sugar and little cakes. I almost don\u2019t want to sit down but why let the food go to waste? I grab a small cake on my way to my side of the table and sit in the chair furthest from him. \n\n\u201cWhat brings you all the way to my estate, your highness\u201d \n\n\u201cFirst, don\u2019t call me that, it sounds like you\u2019re mocking me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow should I address you then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you always call me works fine.\u201d *How am I supposed to know that?!*\n\n\u201cAlright\u201d *I\u2019ll just try to avoid calling him at all.* We wait a moment in silence before he finally speaks.\n\n\u201cHow is your head?\u201d He sips tea and stares at me\n\n\u201cBetter now thank you. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t come all this way to ask me that though.\u201d *Oh what the heck if I\u2019m going to die anyways might as well go out showing my disdain as well.* Shock is written all over his face and I want to laugh so bad. He clears his throat\n\n\u201cTo be honest, since you were hurt at my party, my father sent me here to check on you. So yes, that is exactly why I came.\u201d \n\n\u201cAh I see. Well I had a very good doctor. Thanks to his help I am in perfect health now.\u201d He hummed as a response and we sat in the most awkward silence of my life for the next 10 minutes. I had time to look at him though. He is definitely a male lead. He is handsome. He has dark eyes, almost black but not quite and his hair matches his eyes perfectly. He sits so prim and proper like he has no chill. Of course I guess he has to. He is a prince after all.\n\n\u201cI think that should be enough to say we talked and you were fine.\u201d He muttered to himself. He stood and walked out without another word, leaving the door slightly open. I took a deep breath to calm myself.\n\n\u201cOh god finally!\u201d I stood up and stretched. Grabbed another cup of tea and a different cake. I opened a window and sat on the bay window seat. I happily ate my cake and hummed a little tune overlooking the garden. \n\nAfter I had finished my tea and cake I walked out the room and bumped right into our first male lead. *I hate my life. Why two in one day?! I am not mentally prepared for this!* We were both startled for a moment and stared at each other in shock.\n\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d I said out of habit which made him have the funniest horrified look on his face. He had green eyes and orangish red hair. He was actually kind of short? He\u2019s about an inch shorter than me and I am roughly 5\u20197. I walked quickly past him so I wouldn\u2019t burst out laughing. His expression was just so out of character. \n\nOnce I made it back to my room I had to come up with another plan. I must be prepared at all times to meet with the male leads and NOT make our relationship worse. To my surprise when I got to my room Doctor Pruitt was waiting for me. Sitting in my corner chair with his back turned to me, reading the book I sat out this morning. I don\u2019t make a noise but I stand there and watch him for a moment. *How is this man not a male lead?* I slowly close the door and walk quietly over to him. Once I\u2019m right over his shoulder I say\n\n\u201cEnjoying the book?\u201d He screams and I laugh so hard. Struggling for breath I collapse to the floor. Doctor Pruitt fumbles for a moment.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you come in, are you alright?\u201d He starts to laugh with me. I can\u2019t control my laughter and he just helps me to the edge of the bed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t help it!\u201d I gasp out in between chuckles. He smirks at me\n\n\u201cHow would you like it if I\u2019d done that to you? You would have had a heart attack. I know not to sit with my back to the door again.\u201d He chuckles and starts his examination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry nooooo. Make yourself comfortable please! I won\u2019t do it again!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to need you to stop laughing if I\u2019m ever going to finish your examination.\u201d I burst into a new fit of laughter. You know how once you start laughing it's hard to stop? Yup that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. \n\nAfter a few moments I FINALLY calmed down and he finished his examination. \u201cIt looks like you are feeling much better. A few more visits and you won\u2019t need me anymore. It truly is a miracle that you came out of this unharmed.\u201d I furrowed my brow at his words.\n\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019ll stop coming?\u201d \n\n\u201cWell essentially, yes. You won\u2019t need me anymore.\u201d He looked concerned\n\n\u201cOh\u201d I look out the window for a moment. \u201cWhere is your practice?\u201d\n\n\u201cDown South Street. You\u2019re welcome anytime you know?\u201d I perked up a bit after that\n\n\u201cThat sounds nice. Thank you.\u201d He finishes his examination and bows as a goodbye. I\u2019ll have to visit his office soon.  \n\n\nThanks for reading the third chapter! Let me know what you think! The next post will be on Wednesday the 20th. Sorry for the long wait in between, planning and editing take a lot of time. TwT UNTIL NEXT TIME FRIENDS!",
        "Hello my name is Mohamed and this is my life story.sorry if my English isn\u2019t quite as good I\u2019m still teaching myself haha\nI\u2019m a 22 year old guy from Nairobi, Kenya. My story is pretty much going to show you to appreciate everything in life.\nI was born in the northern part of Kenya and to be honest it isn\u2019t the best part you\u2019d ever want to live in. It\u2019s always hot, droughts throughout the year and it isn\u2019t as developed as the other places in kenya. Even though I was from there life at first was normal for me. I lived a happy life with my family we didn\u2019t have much but at least we were healthy and that\u2019s all that mattered. As a teen I had a dream and my long life dream was to become a football/soccer player. That was my biggest dream and I was working hard all day everyday just to achieve my goal. I was really close to achieving my life long dream and during the tryouts I got the biggest injury I\u2019ve ever gotten playing that sport. I got rushed to the hospital and with a broken leg and few broken ribs. My family didn\u2019t have much as I said so my family had to sell a lot of our belongings just to pay for my hospital bills. And I be honest my dad wasn\u2019t all that happy with the unfortunate situation that I got myself into. A at 18 I left the house to look for a job since my football career or what I wanted to be a career ended and I was depressed for so long. \nSo I went to Nairobi the main capital to look for a job and this is pretty much where my life started to go downhill. Getting a job was the hardest thing to do since I didn\u2019t have any papers to show for it except my high school diploma and getting a job with just that was incredibly hard. I didn\u2019t have anywhere to sleep, didn\u2019t have any food to eat for weeks and no one to even look my way to even help me. I honestly gave up on life at that point, I was very malnourished I just thought of suicide as the only option left for me I was really depressed would cry all night just wondering what my life has come to.\nI don\u2019t know if anything such as fate exists but I just thank God for the little he gave me cause I would be dead by now. \nI met a guy called Kevin and he was basically my savior. He took me, gave me something to eat, a shower, new clothes and basically the reason to live again. He then introduced me to a couple of guys who later gave me a job as a Matatu conductor. And the matatu business is literally one of the best businesses for an investor in Kenya. After Kevin helped me get a job he said goodbye now take care of yourself. It was just like a scene from a movie and I was eternally grateful for what he did for me. \nSo now I got this job as a conductor my job was to basically call people and tell them to get in the bus. It sounds easy but it\u2019s actually kind of hard. Now the owner of the matatu(bus) usually gets as much as 150$ a day and that\u2019s good money if you ask me. I think since I was homeless and didn\u2019t have anything the driver and the owner of the bus seem to take advantage of me. The driver gets money close to 50$ a day and they do me so bad but I cannot complain since this is the only way I have if making even the smallest money possible. I work from 5am to 9:40pm and will make maximum 4$. Honestly it\u2019s so wrong what they\u2019re doing to me and every time I ask for some extra money they tell me to shut up or I\u2019ll get fired. That money isn\u2019t enough to even get me a place to sleep but I\u2019m already used to sleeping in the floor in some garage with dead cars. Every night just sleeping with rats and bugs crawling on me and I just cry. I\u2019m literally tearing up at the moment just wondering what fate has lined up for me. I thought I got a job and I could save up, take myself to school, get a college degree and live a normal happy life but I\u2019ve accepted it. My life is going to be hard for me to go through a day without crying and contemplating what my life has turned into. I\u2019ve tried getting help but it\u2019s all just in vain no one even looks my way , I\u2019ve tried to get a loan but I just get turned away instantly, I\u2019ve tried to get some donation to put me through school and maybe even get me my own matatu so I can make something of my life but fate always finds a way to kick me in the back and say fuck you. \nI went from an aspiring footballer to a useless guy earning 2$ a day. \nIf you read until here I really appreciate it for taking your time to read my story and I wish you a successful life filled with happiness :)",

We ended up asking people how my animation was showing people pictures of Spongebobs fat dick. It was so funny. We freestyled to this one group of people who were so funny. We did gay freestyles and said we were doing gay prostitution. Straight up we sang to a stoned dude. He was so fucking high too. Eyes redder than mars bro.

        "Here we follow the stories of two kids named  Melanie and her crush who is 2 years younger than her and smarter than her named Liam which is why he is in the same grade as and the same class as her. \n\nMelanie has average grades and just like most girls are average unlike Liam who is smarter and has good looks which some of the girls like him but due to him being younger than them he turns down any advances from other girls. They both have their ups and downs with Melanie struggling with sports and math as well as being bad at cooking and Liam only dealing with his fear of having girls chasing him and offending them, his hidden strength because of his daily after school exercise he's afraid to use it for self defense because he may accidently hurt someone, and not to mention he is a bit underweight so he wears up to four layers to not let anyone know that he's somewhat underweight. But they are growing up Liam knew he's growing up and he's afraid of the eventual hormone craziness he and everyone else is gonna experience soon once he and the other students grows up but Melanie doesn't know it because her love for Liam only grows as she grows up so seeks advice about it and accidently bumped into Liam.\n\n(to be continued)",

        "based on true events \n\nIt was the first day of school and no one wanted to be at school, like always i went to my locker got my binders and went to my classes. This continued for thirteen days until September 13th, i was in my math class doing math of course when i got a thought, a thought that will change my life forever. \"kill them bring a gun to school and kill them\" it said i pulled out my phone to text my mother about this i asked her if i can go home but i didn't want to explain why, because i didn't want to worry her. After school i went home i was both crying and laughing at the thought of doing that, later at maybe 4 maybe 5 o'clock i told my mom, she said i could stay home which i thought was cool,for a while, few days later the police took my phone and laptop to search it for any evidence as to why i got these thoughts. for a mouth and a half i was doing school work at home till i had a dream, a dream where i hurt my sister, and my grandmother, i woke up crying at the thought of it. i went to my therapist the next day and told her about the dream, from there the day was fine, i did school work and played on my Xbox, till my mom came home from work early, she was crying she told my grandmother everything, for the whole day me, my mom, my sister, everyone was crying.\n\nmy school hasn't put charges on me and they don't plan on doing so. I've been at the hospital for almost 24 hours i'm going to a psych ward soon i'm not sure when but i know i will, and it'll be good for me to go there.\n\nI'm sorry for my mother i don't know why i'm having these thoughts now especially when i'm in grade 12 and this is my last year of school i put so much stress on my mother, and family members, i'm really sorry for that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you for reading my life so far",
        "When I was 16 I had a job at Dunkin' Donuts. This location was always extremely understaffed, so we were completely desperate for workers. After only a month of working at this Dunkin' we had gone through 3 managers, and about 7 employees, 4 of which about carried their respective shifts and trained every new person, two shift leaders also left the store. \n\nOne of my co-workers, (for the purpose of this story I will call her \"Amy\") had two roomates, a friend and her boyfriend. She spoke to the manager, and had them apply, and they started working at the store with us pretty easily. Amy and her boyfriend were both in their mid to late twenties. \n\nThe three of us would often end up closing the store together, which led to many fights between the two of them. What I later found out from Amy was that her boyfriend and her were arguing at work in front of me because he was apparently jealous of me. Which is super crazy cause, he is mid-twenties and I was 16! He was jealous because Amy and I were some of the most experienced at the store due to the constant leave of other employees and would talk and joke around a lot. \n\nSo one day, we were working an hour late trying to close the store because of how incompetent some people were being. So the two of them get angry and start screaming at eachother, they are yelling in front of me, almost fighting, slamming things, sent some things flying off the counters. They both yelled about how the other never did anything, and the work-related argument slowly turned into their real-life relationship arguments. At one point Amy was getting something from a high shelf and asked for help from a 'tall person\" her boyfriend went to help her and she screamed out \"NO, NOT YOU, I WANT KEVIN TO COME HELP ME\" (I am a shorty at 5'7 btw, and her boyfriend was only about an inch shorter than me). They also put me in the middle of the argument, asking me what I thought about what the other had said. \n\nThis culminated into her yelling at him \"YOU YELL AT ME AT WORK EVERYDAY AND ACT LIKE BIG SH\\*T BUT YOU STILL COME HOME TO ME EVERY NIGHT AND EAT MY P\\*\\*\\*Y RIGHT?\" They proceeded to talk about this act for about 20 minutes while screaming and banigng things, I got out of work 2 hours late that day, and they came back everyday and acted like it didn't happen, although they would continue to have a lot of these arguments at work. \n\nAnyways, don't let people in relationships work minimum wage jobs together. This was very funny but also I was always late out of work so the entertainment came at a price.",

        "Did you just say that? A tale about online dating \n\nSo if you follow me you know I've been divorced for the last 8 years and yes, I have online dated.\nThe only good thing about online dating is I get material for this blog. Yes, in case you didn't know,  I am the Taylor Swift of blogging, I am definitely writing about your stupid ass if the date goes south.\n\nBut I am not that good of a writer to come up with some of these stories that keep my girlfriends in stitches when I come back from a date. My theme song has become \"Another one bites the dust, and another one gone, and another down...another one bites the dust\"\n\nI know you're all singing that song now but seriously it sucks out here. I have dated younger men, my age and older, still the same shit. I went on drive -by dates (For those of you who don't know what that is, it is coffee and you may be lucky if he buys you one, not kidding!)\nI went out to dinner, to the beach, to park dates and somehow it doesn't matter. Why? You ask, what happened?  Well let me tell you about some of my wonderful dates \n\nHow about the guy who likes whips and chains and wants me to walk him like a dog.\n\nOr the guy who has a fedish for being beaten by an Italian woman with a spoon.\n\nHow about the 100s of guys that after the first text decide to send me a dick pic.. Wtf??\n\nOr wait, how about Captain America who dressed like that 24/7\u2026 even to the park on a Saturday morning\u2026\nSee I can't make this shit up! \n\nLast date that bit the dust shows up looking nothing like his profile pictures. He's 5'6 on a good day also not disclosed on profile and has a pot belly. Now before you come at me about why I am a hater, I'm not, I like honesty, say all of this in your profile. I don't care as long as you are disclosing this before the fact but at least give us the option, don't right off the bat, catfish us.\nDon't say you're in shape which lately means round. Or that you work out because in case you didn't know it, lifting your arm to drink beer does not constitute working out. Sorry, let's be clear here.\n\nAnyway, I figured let's see, maybe this may turn out to be a prince in frog's clothing. We had some drinks, talked, he seemed okay and the BAM he goes and does this.\n\nHim:So if you were going to rate me on a scale of 1 -10 what would I be?\n\nMe: (with my mouth open) Excuse me? (Because I really thought I heard him wrong or was hoping I did)\n\nHim: You know rate me, on my looks \n\nMe:(Still with my mouth open)\nRate you? You want me to rate you? Ummm.. I don't know maybe a 8.5\n\nHim: (Dead serious) 8.5! 8.5! That's all! You don't think I'm a 10? I can't believe you didn't give me a ten!!\n\nThis went on for a good 5 minutes, no lie. I'm thinking dude, your 5'6 on your best day, you look nothing like your pictures and you have a pot belly. I actually think you're a five but I didn't want to make you cry so I was being nice! Wtf??\n\nI try to explain that sometimes you meet someone and they may be a 5 but as you get to know them and love them they become a 10 in your eyes. He wasn't hearing any of that and yes, my theme song came on, my que to get the hell out of there.\n\"Another one bites the dust..\"\n\nBut I keep trying, I keep having faith that if I kiss enough frogs that I will find my prince. I am Tinkerbell after all, I have hope.\nI believe in happily ever after. I know there are good men out there because I am blessed to have some great men in my life, starting with my dad's and other great friends and yes, I even had a Prince once so I know they are out there but until I find him\u2026\nI honestly think he's lost in the woods somewhere... but until then I will keep dating and keep writing about these horrible dates and hopefully keep you and my friends laughing.\n\nSo today my friends, don't give up, I know it's bad out there but get together with your friends, have some drinks and tell your worst dating story and laugh until you cry! And to you men out there remember what you do, because we will be talking about you and if you date me...well, I will be writing about your stupid ass.\n\n\"Be the change you want to see\"\n@Treadmilltreats",

I was surprised and got nervous real quick. I didn't respond to her just yet as I needed time to formulate what I'm going to say.\n\nAfter an hour of gathering my thoughts, I then chatted with her. She said she was surprised but she was cool with it. We chatted for a bit, helped her with her research thesis, and said our goodbyes after that.\n\nI honestly don't know if my relationship with T changed or not. She was chill with my confession but we're not really friends. I guess that we're still acquaintances, so whatever. \n\nI'll admit, I was somewhat hoping that she'd be my girlfriend.

        "I used to live in Maryland, the so called hood part. My elementary school had six grade and had a lot of drama. So one day I went to school and everybody was mad at this post a girl from another school made. She said there school was the best and that they challenge all other schools to a gang war. I was not the most popular kid but a lot of people knew me. So I decided to get some friends and people to join me. To my surprise about 90 percent of the school wanted to join. So we set a date to meet up at a park in the middle of our schools. When I got there, there was about 20 percent of kids who actually showed up. We started throwing rocks and sticks at each other which turned to real fighting. The cops then showed up and broke it up. The people who showed up were suspended for 3 days. I got suspended for 5 because I started it. The end.",
        "I live close to my family my uncle lives across the street, and next to him lives his mother who is also my 80 year old grandmother. My parents live several streets over. We all get along because we pretty much stay out of each others private business. I got married and everything was fine with me and my husband and our new growing family until the day the city decided to have road construction on our street several years ago.\n\nWhen the men got finished for the day the Foreman came to our house and asked if they could park the road equipment in the empty lot across the street that was next to my grandmothers house which coincidently was also owned by my grandmother. My husband told the road construction Forman that he did not think it would be a problem but he would have to ask the lady who lived in the house next to the empty lot. My husband them pointed to the house and informed them man that she owned the empty lot. The Forman then left and headed toward her house. I saw him knock ion the door and quite honesty neither I nor my husband thought anything else about it. \n\nThe next day as my husband and I were in our car when my grandmother came out of her house and flagged us down. My husband stopped the car and rolled the window down to see what she wanted. To our surprise all she could do was point her boney finger in his face and called him all sorts of names. At the time we had no idea what she was talking about. We assumed she was confused or something so as soon as she finished talking and headed back to her house we went own about our business. \n\nWhen we got back my father, her son called us and informed us that the reason she was so angry was because the road construction crew had parked the road construction equipment on her lot without her permission. As it turns out the day the Forman asked my husband about parking there, my grandmother was watching out her living room window. She saw my husband point to her house and watched as the Forman approached her house and when he knocked on her door, for whatever reason she did not answer.  The next day the road construction equipment was parked on her lot and she blamed my husband, claiming he gave them permission to park there. He didn't, I was there and I heard him tell the Forman that he would have to ask the landowner if he could park the equipment there. \n\nMy husband was confused because he didn't feel that he had done anything wrong, but because it was my grandmother he went to her house to apologize because he thought it was the right thing to do. When he knocked on the door my father opened the door and my husband tried to explain what happened and my grandmother cut him off and told him some things, that my husband nor my father repeat to me.\n\nI then went over the next day alone when I knew she would be by her self. My excuse was that I had a school picture of my daughter that I was going to give to her. She opened the door to my knock and with a scowl on her face told me that I would have to choose my husband and child or her. She then said the was the wicked witch of the east and I had better not cross her. With a sly smile on her face she glared at me. I handed her the picture and said \"Good-Bye\", I walked away and never looked back.",
        "True story. It's not much of an experience, but it creeps me out looking back.\n\nI had to have been around 12 years old, I was at school with the other kids at P.E. All I remember was shooting hoops and practice dribbling a basketball while other kids did their own thing. The gym teacher was a hands off kind of lady that letted kids do their own thing. I remember nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nGym ends and it's time for lunch. While I was going to the cafeteria, my homeroom teacher took me aside, gave me a tray of food, and told me that I'm not eating at the cafeteria. I asked why, and she replied something to the effect of \"for what you did at P.E\". I didn't want to make a scene and was hungry so I said nothing else.\n\nUntil the end of the day I was in the principles office, I was told that I took a kids( I never talked to this kid, I didn't even know his name prior) finger, and bent it in the complete opposite direction it was suppose to go. My dad at the end of the day told me that the kid was in the hospital.\n\nI responded by saying \"it was an accident\" because I thought I would get in even more trouble if I denied it because they would think I'm lying.\n\nI'm not sure if I was framed or whether something neurological happened to me. A kid that I sort of trusted told me that he saw me do it. Years later I confided in my mom about how I don't remember doing any of it, and she told me that it might have been the adderall I was taking at the time.",
        "My dad and I like to go to my grandmothers house at least once or twice a year to do some yard work and make her house look nice. But a few years ago on the day we were going to go do yard work, I had to go to work in the afternoon, so we decided that we would go to my grandmas in the morning, do some yard work till noon, then I\u2019d leave for home and change to go to work.\n\nWhen it came time for me to leave, I hugged my dad and grandma and wished them both well before leaving. Now the the stoplight next to the entrance of the freeway where my grandmother lives has a two left turn lanes to get on, so on this day I chose the outside turn lane, meaning I\u2019d be closest to the freeway shoulder. So eventually the light turned green and I turned.\n\nNow as I was driving on the on ramp to the freeway, I noticed a white car a few feet behind me turn to go on the freeway and was driving pretty fast to get on. Now I figured at the time that this driver would instantly murge into the freeway the moment they could and speed off, but instead they decided to stay right next to me and pretty close to the car in front of me, and by the time the two on ramp lanes murres into one and the freeway was mergeable, they still hadn\u2019t moved (essentially he was trying to run me off the road) so naturally I honked at him, slowed down to go around him, merged onto the freeway, and sped away.\n\nBut the driver wasn\u2019t done. They sped up to where I was, cut in front of me, and HIT THEIR FUCKING BREAKS!!! My anger quickly turned to fear as I quickly turned to avoid them then drove away as fast as I possibly could, weaving in and out of various lanes in order to avoid hitting any other cars. Eventually I got to a spot on the freeway with quite a bit of cars and slowed down to freeway speed. I thought I was safe for a few seconds, but then in my side view mirror, that same white car was weaving around the traffic to get back in front of me. Thankfully this time they didn\u2019t slam on the breaks, but at this point I was so scared that I went into shock, I just kept driving behind the white car until it decided to merge into another freeway. I did try to go into another lane so I wasn\u2019t behind them, but they merged into that lane too, almond immediately. \n\nI remained in shock long after the white car left till I got home. Immediately after coming to my senses I called my dad and told him what had happened and breaking down crying as I did. He tried his best to comfort me, even driving all the way home to give me a hug. I was emotional shut down for my whole shift till I clocked out.\n\nI never did find out what happened to that driver, but wherever they are, I at least hope they never get into the driver seat ever again.",
        "I met him(we'll call him A) in 8th grade, and basically he was quiet. We were in the same advisory, and there was another kid(I'll talk about him later), that soon became his friend. Somehow, the popular girls of our class were also in our advisory, which I thought was a big downside for me.\n\nSo this is how it started, basically, for some reason, I became his friends' friend, and we had a lot in common(which is later on NOT true).  Then, for some reason, again, I wanted desperately to become his friend, so basically...I followed their \"group\" around. It was all boys, except for me...\n\nI followed them around...sitting next to them in class, joining conversations, and basically I just, you know...got adapted to them. Got to know them better. They were basically weird. They liked this SHARK channel, and that shark ate...CHEESE...and it SCREAMED. And they liked a lot of Marvel, which in my opinion, is cool and weird at the same time. They were critically insane(in a good way).\n\nI haven't had one of them as a true friend until one guy from their group(let's call him TANK). TANK wouldn't leave the table like they would if they went to sit somewhere else. He was super nice and I had it all taken easy. He was only in one of my classes, first period, and I was still happy, enough time to spend and chat.\n\nSomething weird started going on later. One day, during lunch, on a Monday, A's friend, the guy from our advisory, first started chatting about some shit and we were just all listening, or doing our own thing and eating lunch. Then he started saying typical jokes about A, which didn't seem harmful at all; he always does that.\n\nBefore I continue, I just want to let y'all know, A in 8th grade...he didn't take stuff like that seriously. He'd always be this nerd or teachers pet, who cries quietly if he embarrasses himself(like wearing something different), or someone says a joke too far, or...uh...he gets burned with hot glue. He was sensitive and super quiet...but that's because he was new and I'm okay with that, but...\n\nA's friend is also new. And he's like...NOT quiet.\n\nA also had this thing of saying phrases like \"I'm so done with you\" and \"Good for you\", which somehow made people really annoyed and irritated.\n\nOkay, back to the story. So of course, like I said, A's friend was making 'fun' of him, and then A said randomly: \"I'm so done with you.\"\n\nThat triggered the bell. His friend didn't joke around after that. We wondered why, and we all kind-fo felt bad for him...sadly.\n\nA's friend was planning something all along.\n\nTo be continued...",

I ran into the store, grabbed two lemon sours out of the fridge, went outside again, gave Maghoo his, cracked open mine, and the conversation moved to Plug and TSM stock.\n\u2018Everything\u2019s down right now\u2019, said Maghoo, half-heartedly. He then pointed his finger to something red moving fast along the ground and whaddya know, it was that ladybird racing across the pavement full of beans. And I felt a little proud of it seeing it whizz by like that, knowing it had travelled all the way down off the rim of Magooh\u2019s cap.\nWe sipped our drinks and gunned for it as it shimmied off the curb and raced towards the central line of the street under the burning sun. A car gently crawled by in the other lane. Back on our side, the ladybird had started to look a bit parched on the hot tarmac, and took it down a gear. I figured it might need a pit stop, a little refreshment, so I walked over and carefully poured out a small puddle of lemon sour onto the road about a foot ahead of it. The bug sped up to within touching distance of the citrus pool, then paused, it\u2019s antenna whirring around, intoxicated by the sugary drink. And while it stood there alert and excited, a shiny black SUV turned into the road, tires audibly biting the gravel; and rode straight over our ladybird, leaving a solitary bright orange spot on the tarmac where it had just existed.\nAnd soft island music drifted over from a sweet potato dessert stand across the road, invading our silence in the kindest possible way.",
        "I studied the stranger in the parking lot outside the lake. \n\nWalking back and forth, I pretended to look at my phone screen. Sometimes going as far as to answer it and have a conversation with no one. I guess I just didn\u2019t want him to know that I was watching.\n\nFor no reason, really. I just enjoyed this. This deep dive into the soul of another. This inquisition from afar.\n\nI watched as he shifted the weight from one leg to the other. The alternate always shaking.\n\nGod, to think how many calories he must be burning. And when was the last time, he ate anything? He was rail thin.\n\nHe puffed away at a cigarette butt that I was certain was long gone. It was habit. \n\nHe didn\u2019t have a phone. He didn\u2019t have any electronics.\n\nHe sat down for a brief moment on the large rock overlooking the lake. \n\nThe lake was peaceful today. No stray movements. I couldn\u2019t say as much for our stranger under scrutiny.\n\nHe stood up again, quickly. He looked down at the rock, almost as if it had offended him somehow. As if it had dealt him some hand yet crueler than that which life had negotiated.\n\nThis was a man in search of something. \n\nA man in need.\n\nHe approached the lake. That surprised me. He stood stock-still. For the first time today, stock-still.\n\nI could almost feel his memories. His mother bouncing him on her hip. His father teaching him to ride a bike. They were distant, but no less real.\n\nHe moved his hand from the water and I honed in on the droplets. They were memories leaving the brain. Leaving the body as they dripped back into the unmoving void. \n\nHe would leave this place. He would leave this earth. \n\nI held my breath overlong, until he shook his hand clean of the water.\n\nUntil he settled his debts with the memories.\n\nI watched him walk away.   \n \n\nThis would be the last time, I knew it.\n\nHe was headed for the point of no return. With a calmness now. A calmness that caused me to drop the phone and gawk. \n\nHe had a strength.\n\nA strength that I lacked. \n\nA gust of wind swept through. It rippled the lake and shook the large oak tree. It washed away the memories of one lost soul. \n\nI was the voyeur of this adventure.",
        "As a child I would sit on the roof watching the stars pop out at night in the silence of the night, the only time I was never bothered or never questioned on what I was doing. Never told that I was wrong or undesirable and tonight I find myself wishing I could do the same . Your eyes adjust to the darkness and the beauty of it is exquisite.  And when my heart beats loudy I remember the words Joyce use to tell me as a kid. Love is hidden and you will find it, you can make it because you are worth it, a smile keeps the darkness away.",
        "So this story was when I was in kindergarten (surprised I still even remember lol) I went to this\n\n\"christian school\" in riviera this is pretty traumatizing to tell when i was at the school the teachers would beat the kids with rulers on our hands for the most pettiest reasons mind you the school was like k-middle or whatever, and another thing one day in class me and my friends were walking to another classroom for arts and craft just down the hall we were doing like a frog project and being the innocent kid i was messing and poking the glue the fucking teacher picked on me i forgot what she said but she was harrasing me and to put the cherry on top she made the poor kids in her classroom laugh at me over fucking GLUE! i walked out after class with my friends in my class and i started crying in the hallway i shut down the whole day, I dont even know if i told my mom and another thing i had to go use the bathroom so bad but i couldn't tell the damn teacher(she was a older lady that would yell at us kids if we counted wrong remember this is kindergarden) i was afraid she might yell and say why couldn't go earlier!

The human on the other peak of the wave was simply giving a series of orders in a calm voice, but Human Friend Drevven seemed to be growing increasingly more agitated. His furless skin was flushing as the blood rushed to the surface, and his body began to radiate heat into the chill air of the base, enough heat that Seventh Flap was tempted to forgo propriety and snuggle up against the back of the human\u2019s neck, but he restrained himself and waited for the human to finish his call.\n\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d Human Friend Drevven finally concluded in a tight voice.\n\nHe dropped his arm to his side and spun away to march toward the door. Seventh Flap thought about calling out to get his attention, but shouting in the human hearing range was difficult, and if he circled around, Seventh Flap could catch Human Friend Drevven\u2019s eye just as he came into the full sunlight. Then he could get permission to land right on the human\u2019s collar and get both the warmth from the local star and the local large mammal. He prepared to swing around between the human\u2019s head and the door frame but stopped suddenly as the human gave a low snarl and swung his fist forward in an almost painfully slow arc.\n\nSeventh Flap gave a pip of panic and darted forward in an attempt to stop the vector. He logically knew he could never hope to redirect even the mass of the human\u2019s hand, let alone the applied force of the muscles, but he acted on instinct. He did manage to reach the hand before it struck the wall and latched his winghooks into the soft flesh on either side of the bony framework. A moment later however the fist impacted against the wall, and Human Friend Drevven gave a small grunt.\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Human Friend Drevven barked out, jerking his hand back.\n\nSeventh Flap clung trembling to his hand, his sensory horns ringing from the force of the blow that had transferred backwards through the human\u2019s hand. When he reoriented, he realized that Human Friend Drevven was holding the hand that had struck the wall against his chest. The human\u2019s other hand was cupped under Seventh Flap\u2019s perch as a safety net. Human Friend Drevven was speaking to him in a soothing tone.\n\nSeventh Flap shook out his head and instead of dropping to the offered hand quickly scrambled up and peered down at the human\u2019s knuckles. He winced at the damage he saw but breathed easier when he noted that the blood was only seeping out from the skin and not surging as he expected from the force of the blow. Human Friend Drevven was getting more insistent in his demand for Seventh Flap\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Seventh Flap demanded. He whipped around and gave the human his best glare. It still amazed him that his comparatively tiny mass could intimidate the massive predatory species, but apparently when a Winged glared, they resembled some human nightmare or the other. It certainly caused Human Friend Drevven to stop talking and jerk his head back a few inches. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Seventh Flap demanded again.\n\nHuman Friend Drevven glanced between his knuckles and the wall and then shrugged. \u201cI was frustrated.\u201d\n\nSeventh Flap stared up at him, trying to make some sense out of that. \u201cSo you punched the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cYou punched the plasicreet wall with your primary gripping appendage with enough force to damage it\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Human Friend Drevven said, his face brightening up. \u201cThe wall\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nSeventh Flap seriously thought about biting the human in that moment, but he settled for reinforcing his grip on the flesh of his hand. \u201cMedical ward,\u201d Seventh Flap snared out.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Human Friend Drevven suddenly sounded concerned. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\nSeventh Flap stared down at the seeping blood and tried to fight down a sigh. \u201cTake me to the medical ward,\u201d Seventh Flap said as firmly as he could, \u201cand on the way tell me what the connection is between frustration and punching a wall.\u201d\n\n# [Humans are Weird \u2013 A Little Punchy - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/DX3CEkazGf0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBook 1 \"[\u200b](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)Humans are Weird: I Have the Data\"\n\n[Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RSVHL81)\n\n[Barnes & Nobe (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/humans-are-weird-adelia-gibadullina/1138927933;jsessionid=CED1CA2DD868CAE60C7F4EAC8FEDD5E5.prodny_store01-atgap01?ean=9781736003923)\n\n[Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=USta%20eBook%20by%20Betty%20Adams%20-%201230004645337%20%7C%20Rakuten%20Kobo%20United%20States)\n\n[Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# [Humans are Weird: We Took A Vote BOOK 2 | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)",
        "  The world revolves around you. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Every action you take has a consequence, positive or negative, and that affects everyone around you. I learned that the hard way at the bar I run this very day, and I intend to do my best to keep people from making the same mistakes I did when I was a young buck running with the gang. Man those were the times.\n\n  Jim used to run this bar back in my youth, God rest his soul, but I took over not long after that night. I felt that I needed to do so since he put up with our shit for so long. We called ourselves, \"The Pack.\" Even had jackets with patches and shit on them thinking we were all cool and whatnot. Russ, Carl, Frank and myself followed Grant wherever he went and did whatever he asked considering we all owed him for one reason or another, and it kinda stayed that way.\n\n  We'd stay at bars until closing time then find a drunk and rob them blind on their way home. Jim's bar was perfect for that so we usually posted up here since everyone took the alley as a shortcut. Just don't take a wrong turn and hit a dead end. Everyone knew, yet they still did it, and so did we. We ended the night there like we normally do, but when we walked in the place was already pretty much empty. Besides the drunk passed out in the corner, there were these two kids at the bar. Couldn't be older than twelve, easy.\n\n  Now, this already looked all kinds of wrong. The kid behind the bar was as pale as can be with jet back hair, with a black shirt and was no older than thirteen maybe. While the other boy was sitting on the bench across from him with long matted hair and ripped up clothes on a drunken rant about his parents while the other listened intently. At first I thought it was Jim's boy, but Jim didn't have any kids. Let alone he never let us drink like that when we came around underaged and I think that's what pissed off the rest of the guys.\n\n  I thought we were waiting for the drunk to wake up and stumble his way out of the bar and we'd just do our thing like normal, but that's not at all what happened. The one behind the bar hopped over, took the dirty kid by the hand and they went about their business. That's when I noticed the blood all over the pale kids shoes, but before I could say anything Grant had already stood up. We knew what that meant so we followed suit.\n\n  We give them a head start to make it less obvious before starting, \"the hunt,\" as we called it. The dirty kid was stumbling over himself as he continued to vent and the pale one would put their hand on his shoulder to steady him, or even stop to give him a hug before continuing on their way. It was pretty sad, but Grant didn't give a fuck. I could see the malice in his eyes like an alpha being disrespected and needed to set things straight.\n\n  Grant threw a rock at the garbage cans sitting against the wall adjacent to one of the dead ends, startling the dirty kid like a lost puppy as he ran in the opposite direction like he planned with the pale kid running after him. We waited a bit for them to make their way to the end before rounding the corner and there stood the dirty kid shaking like a chiwawa. We spread out to block him from running past us and Grant let it be known that, \"this is for your own good kid to know your place in this town,\" but we didn't see the pale one. Russ was the first to point that out.\n\n  Carl and Frank started looking in and around the trash that was spread across the ground. Lucky me turned around to see that weird pale kid doing that mime thing where they pretend there's a wall and then just stood there with his arms crossed with a smile stretched across his face. I made my way to him while Grant and the guys closed in on the dirty kid and I heard him begging him to leave him alone. \"Don't fuck with The Pack,\" is all I heard from Grant as I ran into nothing.\n\n  I was standing right in front of that pale kid with nothing but air in between us but couldn't go any further, and he just moved his finger back and forth grinning from ear to ear. I went to say something but by the time I turned around everyone was backing away from that dirty kid. All you can hear was skin popping and bones rearranging since it was so dark. When it was all said and done we were standing in front of something that looked like a mongrel with the kids skin and clothes laying in a bloody heap on the ground around it. \n\n  Not a dog. Not a wolf. Not a thing I've seen in my fucking life hence, \"looked like a mongrel.\" Grant and Frank stood their ground. Russ froze and started screaming how it had three tails while Carl fell back, trembling over his words crying, \"it's a werewolf!\" It surely was no longer a boy, but wasn't a wolf either. It had a long snout with massive teeth on such a small head and its hind legs weren't right. They looked like dog legs, but still bent like humans for the most part. The thing had thumbs and everything with a growl so deep you'd think we had a pitbull right in front of us.\n\n  I straight up turned around and started beating on that damn invisible wall and that pale kid just kept smiling. That boy turning into a thing got Grant all fired up with Frank right behind him yelling, \"you think I'm scared?! I'm the alpha in this town!\" That dog things legs made a loud snap as they shifted around to resemble a canine's legs before pouncing at Grant. Coke will make you do some stupid shit.\n\n  Grant grabbed the mongrel mid air and wrapped his fingers around its neck while Frank ran over and started punching it. I can't make that shit up, but the worst part was that it started laughing. Like a child having a grand ol' time. All of its weight made its way to the things lower half to the point where Grant looked like he was holding a hairy bag filled with liquid, then it burst from the bottom with that kid landing on his feet. It had the same canine face with patches of hair all over and its tails wagging playfully.\n\n  Grant's eyes widened as it opened its maw and bit into his inner thigh, ripped a chunk out of his leg and let him bleed out on the ground crying out for his mother. Frank vomited as he tried to run away, but before he knew it the thing jumped on his back. It dug its claws into his chest and bit down on his head letting out an audible crack as his body went limp and they both fell to the ground. The mongrel scurried to its feet then immediately went for Russ who was still standing there frozen and bit clean through his neck making his head roll down his body as he fell to the ground.\n\n  All I can do is keep looking over my shoulder as I broke my hands against our invisible prison while I watched the last of my pack, Carl, get grabbed by his crotch and shaken like a chew toy. His body was thrown around like a ragdoll to the point where it was no more than a bag of flesh with his bones and entrails protruding from rips and tears all over. The kid set his eyes on me next and it now had seven tails flicking the air.\n\n  It lunged at me and all I could think to do was to cover my face and put my leg up like that was going to do shit, and right when I thought everything was going to end I heard a smack and a yip right behind it. I opened my eyes to see the pale kid shaking his head at the mongrel and it put its head down in shame. I think he knew. Like, I didn't want to be there in the first place and was now without a pack. The mongrel shed its fur and reverted its bones once more back into that small dirty kid naked and covered in blood, so I offered him my jacket.\n\n  I was all shook up thinking it was over. The dirty kid politely thanked me, then walked past me like none of that shit just happened and rejoined the pale kid. I was still in shock so I kinda just stood there until I heard a whistle, and turned around to see the pale kid pointing his fingers at me like a gun. He motioned shooting and I felt hot metal sear through my knee and I dropped like a ton of bricks. He blew the fake smoke from his finger gun, put his arm around the dirty kid's shoulder and they continued on their way.\n\n  Spent some time in the hospital for a gunshot wound to the knee and broken hands, but without any traces of a real bullet. Not even in the alley. I just told the police we were drunk walking home from the bar and we got attacked by a pack of wild dogs, because let's face it, no one would believe this shit anyway. That's why I'm telling you to be kind to all, because they made it very clear when the dirty kid said, \"Us weirdos gotta stick together.\"",
        "[trigger warning]\n\n\n\nMy favorite part of the day is when I wake up. \n\n\nIts always 3am, don\u2019t ask me why because I don\u2019t know. I tried staying up all night, I tried taking medications to keep me asleep, but eventually I just gave up and started going to bed early. \n\n\nBut I love the morning time, or at least i\u2019ve grown to love it. Its nice in the silence before anyone else wakes up. Night owls are just then going to sleep and the old folks don\u2019t wake up for another two hours.\n\n\nI usually pour myself some tea and go online. I know it\u2019s unhealthy but I drink almost a gallon of green tea every morning, plain. Just because I can\u2019t sleep doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not tired. \nI don\u2019t really eat breakfast until 8, one hard boiled egg. I keep my daily caloric intake under a thousand. A little while ago I got up to 130lbs and It was horrible. \nThe only problem with my eating is the constant headaches, bruises, and spontaneous scratches. Some sort of vitamin deficiency probably.\n\n\nI don\u2019t live alone, but I miss when I did. Apparently I\u2019m too unstable to live alone, but Im fixing it, I think. \n\n\nSometimes I hear voices but I tell myself they aren\u2019t real. \nIf they were real then everyone else would hear them.\nMostly they just call my name, like a toddler who wants attention and won\u2019t stop trying to get you to look at them and whatever they have to say or show. \nSometimes they remind me of who I am. I don\u2019t like that. \nI\u2019ll remember the bleach in the closet but I never open the door. \n\n\nMy cat keeps me safe, he lays by me all the time. I make sure he gets breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a nighttime treat. He deserves it. \n\n\nI haven\u2019t left my room in a few day now, I don\u2019t want to. Thinking about the outside world gives me anxiety. People see me differently than I see myself. I\u2019m normal, completely normal, but the people don\u2019t think the same.\n\n\nMy cat is my friend and the thing in my room is my friend. I don\u2019t know them, I just know they\u2019re there. Sometimes I hold my hand out at night, sticking it out and into the empty space by my bed. Im waiting for it to grab my hand but it never does. It just exists next to me. \n\n\nIt\u2019s always been there, as far back as I can remember, but always just out of reach. \n\n\nWhen I was 19 I tried to contact it, I went to a lot of spiritual shops to find anything that may work. \n\n\nAll I saw was my own reflection.",
        "The canary tumbles around aimlessly in his cage without purpose. There isn't much in the enclosure, just remnants of things he once enjoyed and vague reminders of what being happy felt like. \n\nThe birdkeeper is irritated by the canary's lack of direction, though he never does anything to help the poor creature. He just looks down on the bird with shame and disgust.\n\"Why don't you ever do anything, you stupid bird,\" he asks, \"Do I not provide all these wonderful things for you?\"\nThe canary tries to explain, but his words mean nothing to the birdkeeper.\n\"Shut up,\" screamed the birdkeeper, \"You're nothing but a useless bird and a nuisance!\" \n\nThe canary bites the hand of the birdkeeper to retaliate, making him incredibly furious. The room flooded with a sour tension as the birdkeepers dead eyes burned bright red.\nThe birdkeeper screams, \"You're going to pay for that, you little prick,\" as he rips the cage door open in a frenzy!\nThe canary trembles backward in fear as he begs for mercy, but the words slide right past the birdkeeper once again.\n\"It's too late to appeal to reason, you little shit,\" the birdkeeper frantically exclaims as he tries to grab the canary! \n\nThe canary mustered up every ounce of strength he could and scratched the birdkeeper's hand. The birdkeeper shrieks in agony and yanks his hand back from the cage. The brave bird sees this as an excellent opportunity to escape, so he leaps out of his cage and flaps his tired wings. The canary makes a beeline for the window. Tears roll down his face as he takes in the fresh air and tastes freedom for the first time in a very long time. \n\nSuddenly, the canary was yanked out of the air and thrown back into his prison with clipped wings.\n\"Don't bite the hand that feeds you,\" the birdkeeper says with an eerie calmness, \"you get to live life on MY terms.\" \n\nThe birdkeeper is afraid the canary won't make it in the world, so he keeps the bird imprisoned. He thinks this is good for the bird; he believes everything he does is beneficial to the bird somehow. Nothing he does is good for the bird. \n\nSure the canary breathes and moves, but he knows he's a walking corpse deep down. He always used to feel so comfortable and free before the birdkeeper came along and shoved him in that stupid rusty cage.\n\"How could you put someone in a cage and expect them to be grateful,\" He ponders, \"No one has the right to take my freedom from me.\"\nThe bird's despair quickly turned to spite. \n\nThe canary finally accepts he needs to get out of this if he ever wants to be happy. He'll never make anything of himself if he doesn't break free. He makes a pact with himself that he's getting away from that life as soon as he can, even it hurts. It won't be today; It might not be tomorrow, but it won't be too long before he's flying high like he once was.\n\n\nI've never written a story before, so this might not be the best one you've ever heard, but I'm very happy about how it turned out. I did a reading of it on YouTube with some music if you want to listen to it instead: https://youtu.be/sD-UxwzB4OY",
        "Two weeks later, in the darkness, her senses slowly felt the feelings of the wind rushing past her sides, and the left side of her face. A vibration and rumbling, a sensation leaning left, then right, a rise lifting her, then a belly dropping dip. Was this a dream of a roller coaster? She smiled inward. Then the smell of leather the feel of it on her right cheek, knowing her arms were around his chest, his chest heaving with each breath. The world now came into view; they were traveling on a canyon road. Vistas of far off mountains, valleys, a long finger lake where the air suddenly chilled, as an automatic response she held him tighter in her arms. Her thighs pressing against his hips, she wanted to lean back and gaze at him to see who he was, it was like she was welded to his back and the cycle. He felt her holding him tighter, with that he dropped his left hand off the handlebar, reaching down he caressed the back of her calf. A sensation ran through her, a wanting, and warming feeling. The hand was gone as the bike leaned sharply right around a hairpin curve. Then accelerated for a long straightaway, a rise in the road, then a drop floated them weightless that seemed to break the hold. Wanting to see who it was that made her want to be with him only, who's presence warmed her heart and body.\u00a0 She leaned back loosening her arms around him, trying to catch sight the side of his face. He felt her movement, turning his face to the left, easing off the throttle, pulling in the clutch, the bikes RPMs dropped to idle, he said \"is everything ok there lil darlin\" it was that same voice \"yes everything's just wonderful\". Clutch released bike picking up speed again, the smell of sage, and desert air floating up the mountainside. The ride was an eternity of near dusk, the Sun setting at the peak of the mountain.\u00a0\n\nThe turns were constantly climbing, just before the apex, he shut down the motor coasting to the crest over to an outlook point. The 360 view was this side of amazing. Sittings there with the Sun now 10 minutes to the setting. \"We\u2019re here lil darlin, I want you to see the beauty through my eyes\"\n\nThat shook her, for at that instant she was inside him looking out his eyes. Feeling the setting Sun's lingering rays warming his face, the restriction of the leather and jeans on his body, the breeze caressing his face.\u00a0 She was a part of him and felt his thoughts. She relieved through his mind, his joys, and sorrows of his past and a feeling of lost love. Sliding off the bike he turned to her sitting there, at the sight of her face the rush of feelings came over him. From his mind she could feel love like she never felt before, there was also a longing, a wanting that at that moment all he wanted was the touch of her lips on his. Looking at her, he saw a tear forming in the corner of her eye \"tears of joy lil darlin are the best tears\" leaning over, she watched her face tilt, eyes close their lips touched and parted, Lighting, thunder, the earth shook. She was back in her own body, climbing off the bike standing at his side. He placed his right arm around her, at that moment she felt at peace.",
        "&#x200B;\n\nI woke up with a sharp, biting pain directly on my right arm. It stung like a thousand wasps had decided that I was their favourite stinging target and that they had been doing it for the entire night without stopping for any reason. But that doesn't fully describe it either. It also hurt like a fire had engulfed that area at the same time as ice and salt were rubbed against it. That is the best description I can give.\n\nI rubbed my eyes until I could actually see clearly and slowly brought my arm up to eye level. What I saw made no sense whatsoever, right on my forearm there were numbers. The first was a five, followed by a two and a three. Five hundred and twenty-three. Why was the number five-hundred and twenty-three on my arm? And why did it hurt so goddamn much?\n\nI poked my finger on my forearm, but it made no difference to the incredible pain I was suffering from. I slowly but surely made my way to the bathroom, thinking that maybe, just maybe, some nice cold water would ease the pain. Spoiler alert, it didn\u2019t.\n\nNot knowing what else to do, I decided to call the only person I could talk with this about. I went through my contacts until I found an S, and highest up on that subcategory was the person I was searching for, Sarah. I was praying she would pick up, and even though it was quite early in the morning, she did. She did not sound too happy to be woken up in the early hours of the morning, considering she barely liked to wake up at all before at least eleven in the morning.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want, Alex? It\u2019s like seven, why are you calling me so early for, it better be important\u201d\n\nI started to try and stammer an answer, but Sarah cut me off before I could even finish a sentence.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay. Take a deeeeeeep breath Alex, in and out and in and out. Now tell me *slowly* what you want. Else, I am going back to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, I will.\u201d I took a deep breath just as she instructed, and it amazingly helped a bit. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it in words, I... I just need you to come over here, now, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure man, whatever. I\u2019ll be there in ten minutes, give or take an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, please actually hurry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pulling your leg, I\u2019ll be as quick as I can.\u201d\n\nI waited nervously by my front door for minutes, in the unbearable pain I was in, before I eventually heard a knock on the door. I instantly bolted up and threw the door open. Sarah jumped a bit at the sudden aggressive door swinging that she was probably not expecting.\n\n\u201cWoah,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cNo need to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust get inside, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, sure.\u201d\n\nShe stepped inside, one hand on the door, both eyes on me. She then closed the door gently and told me that is how you close a door. Normally I would enjoy her humour, but today was a slightly different affair. I took her to my living room and sat her down. She asked if this was one of those interventions that are all the rage and then told me that no, she would not stop smoking weed just because I nicely asked her to.\n\n\u201cCan you just not please, not today, Sarah. I\u2026 I have to show you something.\u201d\n\nFinally noticing the panic and seriousness in my voice, she looked a bit worried. \u201cOkay, Alex, I\u2019ll stop. What is wrong?\u201d\n\nI built up enough courage and pulled up the sleeve of my shirt. She laughed when she saw what was on my arm.\n\n\u201cDid you call me to tell me that you got blackout drunk and got a tattoo and don\u2019t remember it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a tattoo, Sarah, trust me. I haven\u2019t touched the stuff in weeks, this appeared overnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are shitting me right now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019M NOT!\u201d I screamed at her and she jumped back. I felt a bit bad about it, but she needed to take this seriously.\n\n\u201cCalm down Alex, no ne-\u201d\n\nI cut her off. \u201cNo, Sarah, trust me. Have I ever lied to you? I am being one hundred percent truthful right here, okay? Please just trust me.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, Alex, I trust you. How did you get it then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I said it just appeared overnight. It hurts like hell too. I don\u2019t know what to do, and you were the only one I could talk to.\u201d\n\nI suddenly remembered something. It was stupid, but it was worth a try.\n\n\u201cWell, actually\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, actually what, Alex?\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday night. I was bored, so I went onto a website that redirects you to random websites on the internet. I saw someone on Youtube do it and thought it would be something to do. After about eight different websites, I got onto this thing called \u2018the numbers game\u2019. Before I could progress, it put up one of these \u2018accept cookies\u2019 and shit. I glimpsed through it, but I did catch a bit of text here and there when I was speed scrolling through it. One part said something like \u2018you agree to the number you are given\u2019 or some shit. I clicked accept, because that is what we all do, right? So anyway, I click on the \u2018generate number\u2019 button, and it popped up with five hundred and twenty-three. I forgot about it until now. I went onto at least fifty websites that night.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 what you are telling me is that a random website gave you the number five hundred and twenty-three, and now it is on your arm? And it hurts a lot?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really hurts. Trust me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, well then.\u201d She placed a hand on my shoulder and smiled. \u201cThen let\u2019s find out what it wants you to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not smoking weed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck you! Fine, something else then.\u201d She begrudgingly added.\n\nWe started out by seeing if it was individual pieces of cornflakes I needed to eat. When the number didn\u2019t go down. We had to try something else. The list goes as follows, amount of:\n\nCups of water = wrong.\n\nCups of milk = wrong\n\nCups of water mixed with milk = wrong.\n\nCups of saliva = no way (didn\u2019t try).\n\nJumps = wrong.\n\nHandstands = one knocked over chair.\n\nSit ups = wrong.\n\nPush ups = wrong.\n\nPush ups with Sarah on top of me = wrong.\n\nHair picked = wrong.\n\nInappropriate touching between friends = stop Sarah, honestly.\n\nMoney donated to charity = wrong.\n\nCalls to mom = wrong.\n\nCalls to dad = wrong.\n\nCalls to Sarah = wrong.\n\nWeed joints smoked = wrong (why did I even try).\n\nPieces of cheese = wrong.\n\nPieces of ham = wrong.\n\nHigh-fives = wrong.\n\nLow fives = wrong.\n\nAfter about an hour of trying a bunch of different stuff. I eventually just grew tired and asked if we should maybe just go see a doctor.\n\n\u201cAnd tell them what?\u201d Sarah asked. \u201cThat you got a few numbers on your arm and that you don\u2019t know how they got there? They will laugh you out of the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you are probably right, let\u2019s do some research instead. Use my computer while I grab my laptop.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d She belted out while doing a salute.\n\nWe spent a good hour researching. I found a few threads where people talked about something similar, but people just dismissed them as crazy, and they never got updated. I asked Sarah if she found anything, but she told me that she didn\u2019t really find anything either, but that it was nearing time for breakfast, or brunch at this point.\n\nI agreed to the notion of breakfast/brunch, maybe we would be more productive on a full stomach. We got into Sarah\u2019s car and I drove to our local diner because Sarah, in all her wisdom, got bored while surfing the internet and just wanted a little joint of weed that turned into another one that finally turned into \u201cI can\u2019t drive like this\u201d. We decided that even though my arm hurt, it would probably be best that I drove. Whilst eating, I noticed Sarah looking at her phone a lot. I asked her what she was doing, but she just passed it off as checking her social media. Knowing she was not a very active social media user, I just assumed it was something more private.\n\nAs we were finishing our breakfast/brunch, Sarah looked up at me. \u201cAbout earlier, I wasn\u2019t checking my social media. I was talking to this lady on this website. I didn\u2019t tell you about it because you would have instantly said no, but I talked to her, and she said she could help us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d\n\nSarah bit her lip. \u201cA psychic\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, do we really have another choice?\u201d\n\nThinking over all our options, not really. I\u2019ve never really liked these psychics, but I wasn\u2019t too keen on going back home and trying to lower the number with stuff that Sarah thought was logical or surfing the internet for answers that don\u2019t exist. So I swallowed my pride and agreed to see this psychic.\n\nShe then told me it was a three-hour drive. Fantastic that I had nothing else going on this day. We got into her car and I started driving again. The road we were supposed to go on eventually took us onto a small country road surrounded by trees. It was actually quite nice scenery if I am being honest. Not every day that you get to drive in a place like this.\n\n\u201cOkay, so how long left, Sarah?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout twenty minutes, we are supposed to turn off to a small dirt road in about fifteen minutes. I checked the map.\u201d\n\n\u201cDirt road, perfect!\u201d\n\nRight at that moment when I was a bit distracted, looking at Sarah and mocking her, another vehicle ignored road safety laws. It caught me by surprise and even though I braked as much as I could, the car still slammed into the motorcycle. Airbags exploded into our faces. Sarah\u2019s car started to make awful noises whilst the motorcycle was pushed aside. The rider, though, was thrown forward and smashed into the road surface and then slid into the forest.\n\nSarah and I just sat there for a few minutes, in shock at what happened. Neither of us could move. We slowly looked at each other and realized what had just happened. We were just involved in an accident.\n\n\u201cAre\u2026 you ok?\u201d Sarah asked me nervously.\n\nI dismissed her question. \u201cWe\u2026 we\u2026 we should probably go check\u2026 go check on the\u2026 uhm\u2026 the guy.\u201d\n\nJust as I unbuckled my seatbelt, I felt something on my forearm, something different. It wasn\u2019t pain, it was almost like the pain eased the tiniest bit. It felt amazing, it felt so good that I forgot about opening the door. Sarah noticed my hesitation and asked me what was wrong.\n\n\u201cMy arm\u2026 it\u2026\u201d\n\nI slowly pulled up the sleeve of my shirt, and it was different. I gasped and Sarah looked at me strangely. The number had gone down by one digit. From five hundred and twenty-three to five hundred and twenty-two. I showed Sarah my forearm as well, and she said out loud the thoughts I were thinking inside of my head.\n\n\u201cWait\u2026 wait\u2026 does this mean\u2026 that the numbers are\u2026\u201d\n\nHer eyes went wide with realization just as it hit me as well. The numbers were indeed a task. The numbers were the number of people I needed to kill. Only then could the pain go away,  only then would it ease. It was a simple numbers game. Sarah moved her hand to her seat belt button.\n\n\u201cAlex?\u201d Sarah quivered out. \u201cAlex?\u201d she repeated.\n\nI looked her in the eye. We stared at each other for a good minute, in total silence. Her brown eyes staring back at me, a worried expression on her face. I looked down at my forearm again, just to make sure the number actually went down. Just at that moment, the sound of a seat belt unbuckling became deafening.",
        " \n\nI was driving through a Colorado National park when I thought \"Laundry, clothes, Brian Laundry was wearing clothes. His clothes must have some traumatic connection to his past.\" That's how I figured out the origin story of how Brian Laundry became a murderous cannibal.\n\n8 year old Sally Goodman was playing in the swing of a hidden park known to few people. This park was her haven, she came here when she was having problems at home or when her cat died. when she arrived she noticed that she was not alone. A boy about her age was playing in the slide. Their eyes met Sally was struck by the simple innocence in the boy's eyes. She stepped toward him. Sally said\n\n\"My name is sally.\"T\n\nhe child replied, \" I like your name, I'm Brian. what's your favorite color?\"\n\nSally answered, \"my favorite color is red cause that's the color of the hearts on the valentines day cards.\"\n\n\"red is my favorite color too. but i like red because that the color of hearts when they bleed.\"\n\nSally was drawn to brain's goth attitude and how it clashed with his sweet face.\n\n\"I want to bleed for you.\" said Sally.\n\nShe meant that figuratively but she didn't know how literal Brian would carry out her wish. As innocently as only a little boy could, Brian came close to Sally and requested a kiss she accepted. while they were kissing Brian softly bit her lip. she smiled but her smile quickly turned into a face of despair as Brian bit her harder. \"stop it!\" Cried sally. Brian just smiled and bit harder still. Sally screamed as her lower lip came off .\n\n\"NO NO NO!\" she yelled.\n\nShe cried as Brian took out his bazooka and proceeded to pump her full of bombs. blood splattered all over Brian's shirt. He looked down and said,\n\n\"Well I guess today is *laundry day!\"*\n\nWait a minute this is not his origin. He's already killing girls. How young was he when he turned into a psychopathy? I pondered this question for a while and the answer came to me. find out Brian's origin in part two coming soon.\n\nWritten by SnowKingIceDragonTits",

        "[My Worst Date Ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/q6y48j/the_worst_date_ive_ever_been_on/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nSince you guys liked my worst date, I'll give my 2nd worst date. This one isn't nearly as bad but it's still up there. Unfortunately I don't have many more REALLY bad ones after this, just mild bad dates that would make for boring stories.\n\nThis one was another online dating experience, from OKCupid roughly 10 years ago before Tinder (or B.T. for the zoomers).\n\nI met this cute Macedonian girl, short, dark brown hair, bright blue eyes, great light-olive skin. Just my type. The only problem was, she lives in Windsor and I live near Detroit.\n\nI had been talking to her for a few weeks and we decide to meet up. She's still weird about 'online dating', most men are ax-murderers, etc, so she proposed I meet her 'with some of her friends'.\n\nI was fine with this, however I only requested that we don't go to a club. I don't do clubs. Like I said in my previous post, I'm fairly introverted and I literally have never danced in my life (except at weddings while completely drunk). She said OK, no clubs.\n\nI get my enhanced license to meet this girl, which was only like $40 so no big deal, which allows you to go from the U.S. to Canada over the bridge or through the tunnel at any time (like a passport but less expensive and only works for Canada).\n\nIt was around Halloween at the time, and so I dressed as Hugh Heffner to this 'bar' I was going to meet her at. It was a cheap costume, so a thin red robe and belt that exposes the chest area, and long-johns for leggings. This is me being dumb, because it was Halloween in Windsor, it was maybe 50 degrees (Fahrenheit) outside. This wasn't nearly enough clothes.\n\nI get to the place and it's a bar/club, super packed with a 100+ person line of people trying to get in, all dressed in Halloween costumes. I remember waiting in the cold, shivering and looking at people in the building just being weird.\n\nThere was this short, obnoxious guy, with basically no costume on except he had a big dildo sticking out of the unzipped zipper on his jeans. He was just screaming and helicoptering the dildo in circles. It was so dumb that I still remember it vividly.\n\nI get inside after freezing my ass off and find the girl I came to see... Dressed as a playboy bunny... with like 10 of her friends! All girls. All attractive and in costume and hammered. It is intimidating enough to need to impress 1 girl, let alone 10. The music is blasting so loud that you can't even hear yourself think, and the place is so packed that you can't move without getting helicopter dildo'd across the back. The girls are drunk and slightly pissed that it took so long (I was in the line almost an hour), and the girl I came to see was the DD. So we try yell-talking over the music for like 15 minutes and I'm also pissed because I'm like \"I said I don't do clubs and this is obviously a club\". I understand now in my 30s, had I been more extroverted at the time, this could have been potentially really fun, but that just wasn't me in my 20s. I was there to see Macedonian girl and I felt like I was being examined/judged by all of her friends, while simultaneously not being able to talk to them because it's too loud, and I can't drink because I drove there alone across the border. It ended up being extremely awkward.\n\nAfter around 30 minutes of hanging out, mercifully one of her friends goes \"well I'm too drunk, I need to go home\", and Macedonian girl gives me a hug and says \"thanks for coming!\" And everyone leaves.\n\nAs I'm going back home, I look like an insane person. I am 6 foot tall and at the time I was extremely thin, maybe 160 lbs, wearing only a red robe in 40 degree weather. So Customs decides to search me at the border!  They held me there for almost 3 hours and searched my car, patted me down, running my license, finding nothing because I'm just a weird nerd and not actually Hugh Heffner.  I get home at around 4am and had to work the next morning.\n\nUpon retelling this story, the date was mostly bad because of me but whatever, I hope it's a good read.",

        "[2nd worst date](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/q7avqm/the_2nd_worst_date_ive_ever_been_on/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nI am going to preface this with: this was about 10 years ago, using PlentyOfFish & OkCupid. I am married now to a different woman.\n\nTo summarize my dating life at this point (when this girl messaged me), I was getting frustrated with online dating, almost blas\u00e9 due to being on it for a few years with mixed luck. As someone who is relatively introverted, I also find it hard to approach women in a public scenario and my field of work is generally all men. This leaves me annoyed at dating sites, yet reliant on them. My profile became like a joke, I made a fake profile (with my pictures though) hopefully garnering a laugh. Some of the jokes were pretty dark, hopefully to give an idea of my sense of humor at the time.\n\nThis cute blonde girl messaged me and was really straightforward. She basically in a roundabout way said, \"Hey let's just meet up and see if this works, I don't really want to chat on here for weeks and weeks\", and \"people are different in person\" which I agree to, people like to put on a show online. So I agreed to just meet her and set aside my personal rule to chat for a couple weeks before meeting.\n\nWe met at my house, and my medium-sized chocolate lab mix likes to lean on people when she greets them (opposed to jumping on people). My dog went to lean on the girl, and she swatted at her to get her away. Like gave her a quick smack to the face, not full force but enough to hurt. I still regret it to this day, not telling her to leave right then and there. She goes \"I don't like dogs\", so I put my dog inside and we go to leave.  Immediately here I knew it probably wasn't going to work, I love dogs.\n\nThe plan was dinner and a movie, but she didn't want it to be a \"fancy dinner\". On the road I asked, what would you like to eat? Without skipping a beat, this girl exclaims as though she had been expecting me to ask the question, \"Arby's!\" Sure, fine. I'm not a big fan or Arby's but if that's what she wants, we'll get it. She orders legitimately over $20 worth of food (which is a lot back then), so it ends up being like two full combos and a shake because she couldn't choose what she wanted when we got to the window. She ends up eating half of one of the combos and throws the rest away, which mildly annoyed me because she just randomly wasted an insane amount of food. While we were eating, I was trying to get to know her a bit, break the ice with some jokes (which got nothing, not even a chuckle). Everything I asked her resulted in one word responses or just made it hard to continue conversation. As we were leaving, she made a racist comment about the number of black people working at the Arby's.\n\nAt this point, I have already checked out. I've never actually abandoned a date before, plus I was her ride, so I continued and went to the theater. I sat in my seat basically as far as I could from this girl as possible, never looking over at her, even when I could tell in my peripheral she was trying to get eye contact.\n\nWe finished the movie and we're in my car on the way back home, and she says \"That was fun, I can't wait for a second date!\" And I go \"Probably not\". (I admit this was probably a bad time/place and brash) She goes \"Did I do something wrong?\" I go \"We just don't match, we should've messaged for a bit before we went on a date and this wouldn't have happened\". After I said this, she just had a complete meltdown. She started crying, not just a normal cry, a really guttural cry. She cry-yelled about how she had just gotten out of a long-term (2 year) relationship and her boyfriend had dumped her, dating is hard because she isn't used to it and she picked me because I look like her ex-boyfriend (this is making me cringe to type down), and a lot of stuff about how she still isn't really over him. I tried to console her and give her my perspective or maybe offer help but she just brushed off everything I would say as ignorant \"because I'm a man and it's different for men\".\n\nAnyways I got home and she got in her car and left, never heard from her again.\n\nI have plenty of dating stories if people are interested, this is the worst of them, though.",

        "I\u2019ve been called a lot of things, an asshole, comedian ,dickhead, womanizer, alcoholic, man whore, anything and everything, but there was one thing I was called that actually made me tilt my head. The one thing that i was called that always made me really pay attention and stop in my foot steps was \u201cmiracle child\u201d.  Miracle?  Just the thought as I lay on my couch typing this out make me still wonder\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sure at this point you yourself while reading this you\u2019re \u201cthinking why are you a miracle and why does it really stop you in your tracks? \u201c\n\n I was in a car accident at the age of the 3 with my mother and sister. Don\u2019t really know all the details but as far as I know some dick sucker ran a red light and t-boned our car while we were on our way to pick up my dad. Yes I know car accidents happen all the time\u2026\u2026 but let me tell you what injuries we all had. My mom who was driving suffered a compound fracture in her left wrist, crushed her knee to\nThe point she would always need a rocker or wheel chair and she had a scar on her chest from where the seatbelt caused a burn. My sister and I have very similar injuries as we both have scars on her foreheads but they differ slightly.\nMy scar runs from the top of\nMy forehead and follows down to my left eyebrow, where as my sisters scar actually stops before her eyebrow but follows throw to the middle of her scalp. I also have mini scars on my elbows from where I was told it was from me receiving CPR and having them rub against my elbows. My heart stopped 3 times\nThat day and I was amazingly brought back. According to my mother I was assisted by a lady with red hair at the scene and she was the one who brought me back. \n \n Funny enough my mother can tell you the exact things my sister and I were wearing that day, our clothes size and what we were listening to on the radio, when a few days had past my mother wanted to go back to the hospital that took care of us during and after the whole ordeal. She was able to describe every doctor and nurse to the head nurse so they could bring them up to the front so she was able thank them.\nEvery person she described was able to identified and brought up, except one nurse . The red haired nurse didn\u2019t match anyone that worked there\u2026.. in fact no one even remembered or knew of a red haired lady who worked at the hospital or as an EMT.\n\nSo why do I question and wonder the miracle part? My mother died from an over dosed on painkillers before i started high school, I was molested by a cousin when I was 5, I witnessed my mom over dose multiple times . I attempted over dosing , self harm, drunk driving accident  ( that harmed no one) . As a miracle, why is my life so hard? What god saves a child just to have him go though pain and misery\u2026\u2026 know I wonder was it god who saved me\u2026. Or did the devil feel like he didn\u2019t want this story to end to soon ?",

        "  \n\nThere was an Animal which lived in her room, whisking around the corners and the ceiling and floor. At night it came to her bed, and although it wasn\u2019t cuddly or furry, it still nestled up to her warm soft body, its hairy legs poking gently at her. She told Mom and Dad who laughed and talked about her rich imagination. Dad did a whole thing of looking under her bed and flashing his cellphone light: \u201csee Mina? There\u2019s absolutely nothing there. And nothing in the closet either! But it\u2019s absolutely normal for you to imagine there is, baby. All these stories and shows! Have you been watching Coraline again?\u201d\n\nMina felt cross, it had nothing to do with stories and shows, and she never said it was under the bed or in the closet. But Dad had already left her room, leaving her door open. Voices and lights from downstairs drifted in her room. Mina waited. She had sometime caught sight of Animal, out of the corner of her eye, scurrying around making only the tiniest of noises. What did it want, moving so fast? What was it looking for? Food? Animals need food, she knew. She didn\u2019t want to feed it or pet it, she knew children were supposed to love feeding animals and having pets, but she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t like their wet tongues and glistening teeth and heavy mouths near her, and she certainly didn\u2019t like sharing her lovely pink and sparkly bed with Animal. \n\nThe sounds from downstairs were dying down, and it was getting darker. Mom and Dad were supposed to care for her and deal with this Animal, but really they seemed to care more about her going to bed and not being with them. She wished she could get the Animal to go to their room and sleep with them. See how they liked it. Better still, she wished she could kill it, squish it like a bug. Or maybe poison it? Dad used some kind of spray to get rid of ants, didn\u2019t he? She wasn\u2019t sure where he kept it. \n\nThe tiny faint scurrying noises were starting up. Mina held her breath and strained her eyes to see into the shadows at the corner. It was too dark. Maybe she could dash to the light switch and turn it on in time to see it, attack it? But her feet were naked, what if she stepped on it? The noise came closer and she knew it was going to crawl into bed with her very soon. She had a plan, she just needed not to worry about the mess. She flipped to her side.\n\nAs she felt it crawl up her back, she used all her will and in one sudden movement, she lifted herself and slammed herself, back down on Animal. She was bigger than it, and it squelched silently. She lay motionless for a while, and then started screaming for Mom and Dad.",
        "I grew up in a small neighborhood in Mississippi somewhere between rural and small town. My mom worked a couple of jobs to pay rent on a small three bedroom house with my stepfather,  and I was the oldest of three. Things were going okay, it was the late 90s, and summer,  and my mother had saved up enough money to buy me a mountain bike for my 11th birthday. There weren't exactly mountains in the delta, but we made it work with dirt trails built into abandoned construction sites,  and creek beds in the dry season, etc.\n\nNow, I was quiet, but scrappy, and liked to hang around the teenagers because I wanted to be taken seriously. There were two older boys in this group that, in hindsight, were absolute psychopaths. The kind only backwater boredom can breed. They decided rather quickly that they wanted my new bike. They were the kind to \"borrow\" a younger kid's ride and return it in pieces. I was so damned proud of mine that I wouldn't them touch it. I refused to leave it in the yard,  much to my mom's exasperation. Pretty sure I parked it in my closet for the first week or two. \n\nThey eventually spotted me on it and challenged me to a race. These guys were 15 and 16, easily a foot taller than me. I knew it was a slim chance of an actual win, but I also got to pick the track. I chose the service road, uphill around a small man-made lake at the end of my cove. I knew it terminated in a dead end and some shrubs, but there was a short path to the paved road through the trees that I knew about and they didn't. \n\nOn the way, they were lagging behind and muttering about how stupid I was, they could just jump me at the end of the track and take it by force. I knew they were serious, I still have scars from a few rounds with these guys to this day. My plan was to skirt off at the last second, hit the main road downhill and book it home. \n\nWe square up at the mouth of the road, one of them calls three, and off we go. He pulls ahead pretty quickly despite the potholes and mud. We're halfway down when I catch up and he realizes I'm gaining on him. His brother is trailing behind at a more leisurely pace, with about twenty yards between us. \n\nI pull up level with him at the uphill, and I'd only gained maybe an inch on him at this point when he looks over and *spits* at me. He follows it with,  \"I'm gonna knock your $%#@& teeth out, little girl.\"\n\nI'd never been so incensed in my short life, friends. I had this moment of clarity where I realized several things at once. This bully never wanted my bike, he wanted to hurt me. He was afraid of losing to the local tomboy. In front of his brother, no less. Even if I won, he would try to take my bike. Even if I lost, he was going to beat me within an inch of my life for the second or third time. And I was over it. \n\nI hit the brake just enough to fall back, level with him, watching him grin, proud of how he'd scared me. \n\nAnd I planted my foot in his thigh and kicked him off the hill, into the lake. \n\nI didn't watch him go, I turned off into the woods in the opposite direction because I knew his brother would go after him. It wasn't a straight drop,  he rolled about fifteen feet and hit the water tangled up in his bike. He ended up with a twisted ankle and a loose tooth, and couldn't walk straight for weeks. \n\nBut he didn't get my bike. I regret nothing.",

        "Since it's Spooktober and Halloween is coming up, I figured I'd share my disappointing true horror story from last year.\n\nThe Lovely Cast:\n\nWrench Guy: Would-be villain\n\nMe: A dumbass who wanted some candy; 13 at the time\n\n\"Vicki:\" My best friend; 12 or 13 at the time\n\n\"Leo\": My younger brother; about 12 at the time\n\n\"Charlie\": My brother's friend; about 12 at the time\n\nVicki, Leo, Charlie, and I were out trick-or-treating. Sure, we were teens and almost teens, but we wanted free candy. My dad was with us, since our parents weren't comfortable sending us out without an adult. We were having a pretty fun time, not really caring about much other than candy. At some point, we encountered a bunch of kids from school, who told us there was a crazy guy walking around with a wrench. We ignored it, since kids usually made stuff like that up around Halloween (for example, people said there were a bunch of killer clowns in the neighborhood one year. There were none). We kept on walking and stopping at houses, not talking or thinking about Wrench Guy. Then, some time later, while we were walking around a curve, we saw him. He was wearing a hockey mask and carrying a wrench. Luckily, since my dad is 6'4 and was wearing a jacket that made him look really muscular, he didn't approach or threaten us. Charlie was pretty startled and Vicki and I wondered if that was actually Wrench Guy, but Leo thought it was nothing, and the rest of us eventually decided we agreed.\n\nNear one of the last houses, we saw four kids about a year or two older than us looking terrified. We talked to them and found out they had apparently been chased and threatened by Wrench Guy. we calmed them down with bad Among Us jokes and assurances that Wrench Guy wouldn't come after us while we were all in a big group in front of a house, while my dad and the owner of the house called the police. My dad had us go home after that, despite our protests.\n\nWhen we got home, we were chilling and trading candies, and my parents told us what had happened with Wrench Guy: He was arrested, revealed to be a fourteen year old from the next neighborhood over, and driven home in a police cruiser. Now that the threat was gone, Leo, Vicki, and I wanted to get more candy, but Charlie was too scared to go back out, which we accepted. So we just ate our candy and hung out until it was time for Charlie and Vicki to go home.\n\nWelp, that's my disappointing true scary story. Not quite worthy of a horror movie, but I'll never forget it, that's for sure.",
        "*Three years before the dimension incident*\n\n\"Okay soldiers listen up.\" The gritty voice of Sergeant Boom bellowed from the front of a room full of superheroes.\n\"We are going up against what is basically an entire army of dancers aliens. These aliens can rip you to shreds faster than you can say Holy shit. So be aware of what you're doing.\" Hayden whispered over to Ella.\n\"I wish he'd stop acting like he's actually the leader here.\" Ella sighed and looked at him.\n\"Ugh I know right. He's so lost in his own little world that he forgets that this place is basically just a government thing.\" She responded tiredly.\n\"I mean how can one man be so awesome yet so annoying? I saw him once use a bucket to scare a guy, and it worked. Now he's spending his nights on making elaborate PowerPoints that nobody needs. He's changed so much.\" Hayden claimed sounding annoyed. Ella laughed quietly.\n\"Hey you know you didnt need to come right? I just thought you would rather be you know back home, playing games, watching cartoons or something like that. I dont need you to be here.\" Ella admitted embarrassed that the one person she found cuter than anyone had shown up just to help her out.\n\"Well you helped me out with homework a few days ago I thought I'd return the favor. Plus you might not need me but I want to spend some time with you.\" Hayden replied a little nervous that she was annoyed with him coming. The hair on his arms stood up as he saw who they'd be up against.\n\nNedyah. The one villan Hayden was most hateful towards because he was him. When Hayden first got his powers Nedyah was born from his mirror and was basically Haydens opposite.\n\"Nedyah has an army now ? D-did you know you'd be fighting him?\" He questioned getting a little worried now.\n\"No i thought it'd be maybe brutus barley. You can leave if you want Hayden I won't make you stay.\"\nElla claimed as she put her arm on Hayden's shoulder trying to comfort him.\n\"No i want to. Cause now with more people I can finally have a chance of kicking his ass.\" He said trying to get himself hyped up. He then flew up to the front where sergeant boom was a few minutes ago and now stood a tall man dressed in a suit and tie about to tell everybody who they'd be fighting.\n\"Excuse me sir would it be okay if I were to give everyone the briefing?\"\nHe asked as he tapped the man on the shoulder. And as the man turned around he realised who it was.\n\"Oh of course mr ultra boy sir. Heres my file.\" He responded as he handed Hayden a file with all the info he needed. Hayden used his super speed to read it as fast as possible.\n\"Thanks. But please don't call me sir.\"\nHayden requested. The man gave a quick nod then walked off. Hayden walked onto the stage and started speaking.\n\n\"Alright listen up people.\" He Exclaimed confidently trying to get everyone's attention.\n\"We are going against this asshat. Nedyah. I personally thoughts it best that I brief you all as I know him more than anyone. Now he's trying to recreate an almost impossible event where a portal was created large enough to bring a whole planet through to not only conquer this world but the other one too so we need to stop him. Alpha squad you guys are with me since you all have some kind of power that can be used to move from place to place. Beta squad you're staying near the ship and protecting it. Gamma you guys are all brutes so you'll be our first bit of offence. And the rest of you just charge in. Let's kill this piece of shit.\"\nHe flew back over to Ella and the rest of alpha squad. Ella put her hand on his shoulder.\n\"Hayden that was amazing. You were awesome up there man.\" She hugged him tight but then let go just as fast.\n\"Sorry sorry. Just got excited.\" He then looked at her and hugged her.\n\"Thanks. I needed a hug from you.\" He let go of her to get ready to go.\n\"Okay is everyone ready to kick some evil interdimensional ass?\" The crowed roared up with yeah's and woo's.\n\"Well then lets go.\" The doors opened and they charged into an absolute ocean of evil creatures.\n\n\"Okay alpha team lets get up there.\" Hayden yelled to his team. Some flew towards an open window, some teleported and some used portals but they all still got up there.\n\"Okay everyone lets split up. Predictor and Organatron you two go together.\"\nHe pointed at the humanoid robot and the wizard.\n\"Affirmative.\" Replied Organatron\n\"I knew you'd say that.\" Claimed Predictor. Hayden rolled his eyes at the future seeing wizard.\n\"Whatever just go. Flashbang and pipsqueak you're also a group.\"\nHe pointed this time at a speedster and an absolute brute.\n\"Of course boss. Come on Pippy.\" Flasbang responded already holding Pipsqueaks arm.\n\"Watch it flashy.\" Exclaimed pipsqueak moving his arm away swiftly as he walked far behind him.\n\"So that leaves you and me Ell. And there's only one path nobody took.\"\nHayden proclaimed enthusiastically even though he could have been killed by now.\n\"You\u2019re happy. Come on lets walk and talk.\" Replied Ella pushing Hayden forward.\n\"I'm happy because in this place i can probably kill Nedyah for good.\" Hayden exclaimed adrenaline rushing through his body like blood.\n\"I mean sure he's faced me one on one before but I dont think he's faced us as a unit before.\" He looked over at Ella belief in his eyes and voice.\n\"Well let's hope so. He injured a whole town building this place. And its not even that good. I mean I'm not an interior designer but man do the colours clash.\" Ella groaned her eyes hurting just by looking at the walls. Hayden sighed with relief.\n\"Oh thank you for mentioning it i could not agree more. Just look at it red carpet blue walls its like a terrible play house.\" He stated hating the fact that he had eyes because of this place.\n\n\"Just try and focus on one decent\u00a0 looking thing until we get to the other side of this hallway.\" Ella turned to look at Hayden.\n\"Done. At least I've got you Hayd.\" She stated thankful that she could focus on him instead of the rest of the terrible room around them. Hayden stopped for a second trying hard not to blush but failing miserably.\n\"Uh th-thanks I guess. Ill try and focus on you too.\" He turned his attention to her to avoid almost vomiting.\n\"You know we could go in one of these rooms and see if there's another way to the main room?\" She asked pointing at the various doors around them.\n\"Huh you know what good idea.\" Hayden kept his eyes on her and felt around behind himself to find a door to go into. He then felt a doorknob in his hand and grabbed a hold of it.\n\"A-ha. Got one. Just walk towards me.\"\nElla nodded and walked with him into the room behind them.\n\nThey walked into the room and immediately shut the door.\n\"Oh thank god that's over.\" Sighed Ella happy she could no longer see the hallway outside.\n\"Yeah. Wait this place looks weirdly familiar?\" Hayden stated confused about where they were.\n\"Oh my god its a weird prison based on my room. Just without all the cool parts.\" He realised as he looked around and recognised the layout of it.\n\"Oh yeah I remember this place now. I also remember how comfy your bed is.\" She flopped onto the bed and fell onto a big block of nothing but hard concrete.\n\"Oww what the fuck. Why is your bed so hard?\"\nShe asked the pain in her back making her slouch.\n\"Well this place is just the opposite of my actual room so obviously he decided to make my bed hard as rock.\" Hayden replied hastily helping her up as gently as possible.\n\"Hey Ella listen I need to say something to you that I've wanted to say for a while.\" He said as Ella searched around the room looking for a way out.\n\"Uh okay what is it?\" Ella questioned wondering what he meant.\n\"Well uh. You know what nevermind lets just focus on the mission for now.\"\nHe requested trying to change the subject and started looking around the room with her. Ella raised her eyebrow in confusion at that statement.\n\"Uhm okay?\" She went back to searching and found a piece of paper.\n\"Hey I found something. And I think I remember what it is.\" Ella proclaimed as she pulled it out from under the bed.\n\"This is the note I wrote you when we were little. You kept this?\" She said almost as though she was looking at an artifact of ancient history.\n\"Well yeah. You were the only friend I had so I kept it. And when I was down and felt like I was alone and didn't belong I'd look at it and read it and I'd feel better.\" He replied thinking happy thoughts of their childhood.\n\"Wait a second.\" He grabbed the note and looked closely at it.\n\"Did you purposely write letters in red or is nedyah messing with us again?\" She looked at it realising what he was talking about.\n\"Oh yeah I used to do that a lot dont worry about it.\" She responded hearing footsteps down the hall.\n\"Guys get down now. We stopped his portal but he's chasing us. Meet you back at the ship.\" Yelled Predictor panicking. Then the walls came crashing down leaving all of them in freefall. They all tried to grab eachother and float down gently. However they were separated by a bolt of dark lightning. Predictor let go just in time but let go of Hayden and Ella. As they landed they heard a familiar laugh.\n\"Well well if it isn't ultra boy. Still holding onto these weaklings I see?\"\nAsked Nedyah sarcastically floating down as though he was a god.\n\"You mean the \"weaklings\" that just stopped your plan without me? Yeah I am.\" Replied Hayden confidently.\n\"Well they didn't stop it. They just delayed the inevitable. Like the inevitability of your death in like 10 seconds.\" Responded Nedyah slightly annoyed with Hayden now. He snapped his fingers and his army gathered around Hayden and Ella as he flew away in a flash. Then Ella saw a familiar gem on the floor.\n\"Hayden look its the crystal of power. I'm gonna try and use it.\"\n\"Its impossible Ell there's nothing we can do.\"\n\"Just trust me.\" She leaped towards the crystal and in a beam of light she became ten times as powerful as she was before.\n\"Duck.\" Hayden did as she asked and curled up into a ball on the ground. She blasted a beam of light from her hand and evicerated any enemies she could see until there were none left standing. She took a long breath and looked around to make sure there were none left.\n\"Holy shit Ell that was so fucking cool. You are amazing.\" Hayden almost crushed her with how hard he was hugging her.\n\"Whoops sorry forgot my own strength.\" He quickly let go of her and started flying back to the ship.\n\"So Hayden you wanna go to the bean building after this?\" Ella asked tired after using so much power.\n\"When don't I?\" He flew onto the ship and as the door closed he could have sworn he saw one last soldier standing but it was probably his imagination.

Fives!\u201d First Field Ranger called out.  \n\nFifth Sister let her frill ripple in amused irritation at the shortening of her designation and the friendly imposition it showed. She tilted her head to focus on the approaching human and shifted her tablet to reach a hand out in greeting.  \n\n\u201cYo.\u201d She awkwardly used the informal greeting. \u201cFirst Field Ranger. How are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cFair to middling,\u201d First Field Ranger answered, swinging the mug of coffee he was drinking with one hand while his other was clamped tightly to his side.  \n\nFifth Sister curled her antennae in suspicion as she realized that the human was holding the mug in his left hand. He was still dressed in the full membrane covering that they wore under their extravehicular activity suits. The tight angle of his lips suggested the rigid control they used when hiding some emotion.  \n\n\u201cI was wondering if you could pop over to the storage bay and take a look at my suit?\u201d the human went on. \u201cTook a bit of damage while I was out this morning, and I want to know how long it\u2019ll be out of commission.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is well within my duties,\u201d Fifth Sister said slowly.  \n\nThe human was clearly hiding something. She wasn\u2019t sure what, but she had enough experience with the species for her frill edge to be prickling. She just wasn\u2019t sure at what yet other than that the distinctly asymmetrical First Field Ranger was using his non-dominant hand when his dominant hand was clearly free.  \n\n\u201cGreat!\u201d The human bobbed his head eagerly. \u201cCan you have that done by lunch? If you can, then I\u2019ll send the data to the fab-bay for parts, but I have things to do and places to go before then.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can fit that into my schedule,\u201d she said.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a life saver, Fives!\u201d the human called out before pivoting and strolling down the corridor.  \n\nFifth Sister flicked her antennae in irritation. Rudeness aside, the human\u2019s bipedal stride also displayed the strange, overly controlled movements that his facial expression had. She flicked out her antennae in frustration and continued to the storage bay. The stench of evaporated polycarbons caused her antennae to curl as the doors cycled open. The source of the leak wasn\u2019t hard to find. The human\u2019s suit was hanging on the storage rack. The armor plating was missing a significant portion of the mass it had boasted this morning.  \n\nFifth Sister crossed the bay slowly, her frill and antennae extending in shock. She reached out and spread her digits over the damaged surface. She couldn\u2019t reach the outer edge of even the central portion of the damage. The armor had clearly taken an energy blast; perhaps a stray laser discharge, the inspection should tell her. Whatever the cause, the outer layer had experienced a massive evaporative explosion incident.  \n\n\u201cThe force would have torn the outer membrane,\u201d she clicked to herself.\n\nShe shook out her frill and reminded herself that this was a human she was dealing with. Membrane damage meant very little to them. It was that peculiar calcium rich endoskeleton that would have taken the blunt force damage. She recalled the odd position of First Field Ranger\u2019s dominant hand. As if it had been offering support to something internal.  \n\nFifth Sister clicked her mandible in frustration as she activated the scanners on her tablet. Of course her work would be done by the time First Field Ranger returned. However analysis and repair of damaged materials were not her only functions. She dialed up the medical bay as she worked.  \n\n\u201cGreetings, Third Sister,\u201d she said politely, \u201cI suspect that First Field Ranger is attempting to hide an endoskeleton fracture.\u201d\n\nOn the screen, Third Sister\u2019s antennae barely flicked with surprise. \u201cWhere will be the best place to catch him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suggest you conceal yourself near the chocolate,\u201d Fifth Sister advised. \u201cThey seem most vulnerable there.\u201d\n\n# [Humans are Weird - A Bit of Damage - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/KgLrCpGW2ks)\n\nBook 1 \"[\u200b](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)Humans are Weird: I Have the Data\"\n\n[Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RSVHL81)\n\n[Barnes & Nobe (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/humans-are-weird-adelia-gibadullina/1138927933;jsessionid=CED1CA2DD868CAE60C7F4EAC8FEDD5E5.prodny_store01-atgap01?ean=9781736003923)\n\n[Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=USta%20eBook%20by%20Betty%20Adams%20-%201230004645337%20%7C%20Rakuten%20Kobo%20United%20States)\n\n[Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# [Humans are Weird: We Took A Vote BOOK 2 | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)",
        "They didn't get very far before they found the the dead body.\nTim kneeled down and  studied it carefully for a moment.\nHe stood with a puzzled frown on his face.\n\"What is it?\" Asked Dana, tempted to study the body herself. \n\"No signs of bodily trauma,  but there is one strange thing. Two actually. \"\nHe said as he dusted off his pants.\n\"Just spill it already.\" Frowned Dana. She was losing her patience. \n\"He has been completely drained, look at his coloration. No rigor. He's bloodless.\"\nDana knelt over the body and studied it.\n\"That is odd, how do you bleed to death without bruises or injuries?\"\nShe asked as she stood and dusted herself off.\n\"That's the second odd thing, did you notice the marks on him?

        "There was this one girl I met in an online community an 1st August 2020, where it started all.\n\nWe had a really good time, played a lot of games, watching series and movies, chatting every day. Not only like normal Friends, no, like really good friends, joking about marriage and hopefully meeting someday.\n\nFinally I booked a flight to Portugal on 1st August, to met her.\n\nMoney spent until now: 2.000+ Euro Cash, 500+ Euro Flowers, 700+ Euro Food and some more hundres for Games and Stuff.\n\nAllright, the week was pretty good, she showed me a lot of Portugal and we had some fun.\n\nAs she would go to University Soon, I gave her my iPad Pro 12.9\" with Magic Keyboard and Pencil, another 1.500 Euro.\n\nAs we were walking on the street she asked me when were gonna marry now, and I really loved her, and I thought she loves me as well... (I didnt know she had a boyfriend)\n\nSo after a bit more than a week I went back home and started working again.\n\nI was busy most times but we still wrote. A few days later her Notebook broke and after bring it to an IT specialist it was not repairable so I bought her a new MSI Raider, another 2.000 Euro\n\nI gave her the money and she picked it up in store, but didnt do the warranty extension cause they told her she had to get a new ticket and wait again.\n\nSo I was in contact with support and after a few days I finally managed she could pay by MB Reference.(online)\n\nThen she just told me she dont have the money anymore. I asked her why, so she told me her father didnt get the money from work yet, and they need it to pay the rent. So I asked her why she didnt told me. So she started like she has to tell me nothing, its her money and not mine. I told her well it is actually my money you spent, as I only gave it for the Notebook and Warranty extension. Well so as things went worse anyway I took a break and said I will write her before Uni starts. One day before I wished her good luck and no reply.\n\nAfter all now she blocked me everywhere, and is laughing at me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The end of the story, simple an expensive fake relationship.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPros/Cons: Her birthday is on 15th Oct, imagine who already booked a flight from this Friday to Monday? Yes its me, also booked a suite so I will stay there alone, go outside and getting drunk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I dont know what to do with her birthday present, its a drawing of Demon Kings Academy, as we both liked it and she called me King and I called her Princess, showing me as Anos and her as Sasha.\n\nI printed it in A3 so im not sure to just leave it at her home or throw it away, what do you think.\n\nFor sure I will show it to you.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/DdtP16H](https://imgur.com/a/DdtP16H)",

        "CW/TW:\n>!Sexual harassment against minors. Relationship abuse against minors.\nLanguage, Sex, profane language.!<\n\nWe all went into the kitchen to get the prefilled water mugs carts we divided into two groups and four floors. Me, My friend Hosea, and two 16 year olds were to go to floor 3 and 4 and replace waters mugs. there would be a cart or two full of new waters. One of us would go in with gloved hands to take the old waters and one would go in with the fresh mugs. Hosea and I did that\u2019s while they pushed the cart and handed us straws. The two kids were on the same high school basketball team that Hosea was on, so they knew each other. However through Hoseas dark eye lashes I could see that he hated them as much as me. \n\nI would go in to a room with 4 mugs after Hosea took the dirty mugs and I\u2019d but the water on the bed side tables. Some people would give a thank you, some were asleep or out. The worst was when you\u2019d place the mug and they\u2019d wake. In a place like this sleep was a virtue.\n\nThe two kids outside were talking about an actress. She was in a famous children\u2019s movie that followed the actors into adulthood. The lead actress was beautiful in all senses. She was very pretty but she was also a feminist and overall a nice person. She had trouble through out her life though because people sexualized her from when she was seven. It reminded me of Francine with less beauty\u2026 When I came back for more waters, we were halfway through the hall. The kids were talking how they\u2019d like to smash or pass her. I heard one of the guys saying he\u2019d fuck her. The other guy said she was just a bitch and a tease. My hands shrank to fists. I could feel the scabs of my knuckles peal as I tightened them beyond their ability. My face turned white and red with veins baring my face. I couldn\u2019t hear anymore and visions of Francine flew before me.\n\n***\n\nFrancine and I were barely aquantences. She left before any chum-ery occurred. Really the first thing I heard was she was looking for a boyfriend and the last I heard was she was getting the fuck away from them. She left after Grade. 5 to a all girls school. Its what you did when you had money. I heard here and there that she had a boyfriend. She cycled through them I think one every 9 months. I joined an elite all boys school and dropped out after 2 months. one of the reasons I dropped was they promoted one kind of person. White, militant, fit and smart. Besides the first thing I wasn\u2019t there model student. I think I saw her once in that time. Are two schools meet up with each other as they where both single gender. Three years later me and a friend talked about her. My friend and I hadn\u2019t really seen each other. We drank and talked about are days in middle school. He talked about Francine. He went to her house one night when his and her parents where having dinner. After getting board talking to adults he found him self in the basement with Francine and three other guys. She was sitting criss cross on the couch with one of the guys wet head on her thighs like a pillow. She was equipped with a brush and a hairdryer. In front of her loose crop top the guy was looking up. There were 2 other guys with wet hair talking among them selves, waiting for there turn to get their hair done. She was a polynogamous lady. She didn\u2019t believe having to stay with one man for her life. My Christian side winces talking sex but truly everyone and their parter or partners should have fun with there time on this big blue marble. \nThen something happened. Suddenly a bunch of boys from my old high school started to send her unsolicited dick pics asking her for ratings and calling her a bitch if she didn\u2019t respond. Some guys also sent her fantasy paragraphs of what they would want to do to her. Truly something a 16 year old should not go through. She stopped going to school for a month. Came back a women. To deal with something like that thrusts you into adulthood. It takes fucking guts man. I will always admire her for that.\n This isn\u2019t the first time scum fuckers prevailed at my school. when I was there in Grade. 9 a Bunch of boys set up a dropbox between themselves. They would talk to their girlfriends and ask for nudes. If they got any they would put the pictures in the dropbox. Essentially it was an illegal pornography group, and all involved were minors. Suddenly the group got bigger, more boys with more pictures. When the pictures got back to the woman there was a moment of being unsure. Here a dozen of underaged girls had a choice say nothing and try to forget or let the old fashion christian school know, scold the girls and talk to the police getting press involved and God knows if their identity will be properly protected. They had to go with the second option. My school kept the scum fucking boys identities anonymous and didn\u2019t have a statement on there punishment meaning: barely anything. As for the girls in that girls school, they got a lecture in health class about why you shouldn\u2019t send pictures. It\u2019s like what Kurt Cobain said, the women aren\u2019t the problem it is the boys that must be educated. I never heard about the whole dropbox thing until right before starting my volunteering. God knows what else my Jesuit school kept from the public. One of the victims revealed her identity so she could voice what the group of victims felt. She is a fucking saint. \n\n***\n\nThese two volunteers caught on to my presents, Hosea was next to me and back with four dirty mugs. I looked like I was breathing in air and exhaling diesel exhaust. I wanted to kill em. Hosea said something like \u201cStop being fucking chodes\u201d to the two. I still couldn\u2019t hear. With their volleyball captain scolding them and a madman ready to tear their heads off, they shut up. I went to piss in the bathroom. I calmed down a little bit but I never respected those kids again. I never respected my former school for the ability to foster such scumfuckers. I wanted those volunteers to grow the fuck up or get hit by a bus, ether worked for me at the moment. I came back and they were gone. When they finished Hosea said he could take the dirty mugs to the kitchen. I found him pushing and pulling the two carts. I apologized, Hosea asked what for, \u201cthey deserved it\u201d. He was a jock but at least he was righteous in a sense. We talked a little about hockey while putting are hairnets and gloves on in the kitchen. We put the cart next to the 2 meter dishwasher. When we exited taking are hairnets off he said \u201cdon\u2019t worry about those kids, there summer volunteers they\u2019ll be out before the 15th hits\u201d. \u201cYeah I wanted to kill those fuckers, they reminded me of those fucks from the dropbox thing.\u201d \u201cDropbox thing?\u201d",
        "\"Hey, I heard your birthday's coming next week.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's right. Its on Friday.\"\n\n\"Oh, so you'll take a vacation leave then\"\n\n\"Nah. I'm busy that day. Maybe I'll just celebrate on the weekend.\"\n\n\"I see. What are your plans?\"\n\n\"I got nothing. But I really want to go to the beach. Its been so long.\"\n\n\"Yeah you should go! I can tag along. \ud83d\ude05\"\n\n\"Really? Let's do it then.\"\n\n\"Sure? Game! Let's go to the beach, saturday and sunday.\"\n\nThen came the weekend. They arrived at the beach somewhere south. They were greeted with pristine bluish-green waters, pearl white sand, and the refreshing breeze of the ocean. They settled their stuff in the room and immediately went to swim.\n\nIt was not a sunny day, in fact, its been raining the day before and the sky looked like its about to cry. But she was very happy since its her favorite weather. She was wearing a white tshirt  and a black shorts. She had her hair tied up. He was wearing a swimming trunks, and his upper body is bare. They were enjoying the swim.\n\n\" I wish I know how to swim. All I could do is float. I want to learn free diving too. I want to see the ocean and everything in it.\"\n\n\"I tried free diving once. It was surreal. I can teach you how to swim now, if you want.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nHe told her to lie horizontally while he'll hold her with both his hands under her body. She complied. She was able to float but she can't swim forward. They were laughing a lot. Then, as he was guiding her, she tripped in her feet and he caught her, holding her waist close to his body, their faces 5 inches away from each other.  \n\nIts like the time stopped. They could hear each other's breath. They could feel each other's heartbeat, now seemingly faster than before. They were staring straight to each other's eyes, but he then looked at her lips. He stared back at her eyes not breaking contact. She looks at him, with her heart racing, thinking about her feelings, her desires, her fantasies. She sees same thing in his eyes. She breaks eye contact and stares at his lips. Just when she's about to look back into his eyes, he moved, closer to her face, she almost stopped breathing, she allowed him to be closer, then he kissed her. \n\nTheir lips touched, but their soul felt like its merging. He grabbed her tighter, closer to his body. She felt his gentle lips pressed against hers. She didnt know what to do. He then lifted his head, back to the 5-inch gap. He waited for her, to say something. But his hands are still on her hips. He was scared. He didnt know how she'd react. He almost panicked. Then, without any clue, she raised both her arms and placed it in his shoulders. She kissed him, but only this time, it involved movements. She kissed him, and gulped him. She moved her tongue to part his lips, and found his, now both intertwined. They were both sucking each other lips, her hands on his head, his on her waist. They were feeling extremely hot, but is muted by the sudden cold rainfall.",
        "So, me and my mum went to this road side diner (I don't know what their called...) and it was early morning since we were preparing to go somewhere and were going to go to the mall to buy things for the somewhere.\n\nSo alongside the road, there's this road side diner, it was early and we wanted breakfast. We went to the diner. I ordered chicken and waffles and my mum order grilled cheese ad coffee. After eating, my mum had to use the restroom and then the waiter came to me, as a naive 12yr old who was taught to share and knew what tips was, I thought \"Maybe I cloud tip him my last waffle!\". I didn't know how tipping worked...\n\nThis waiter guy came up to me, asked where my mum is and if I'm done. I answered \"She's in the restroom\" then I said \"Can I tip you my waffle?\"... the face this waiter made. Then the lady behind the counter asked \"Did he try to give you waffles?\" waiter man nodded, and I just sad there, oblivious to what's happening. \n\nMy mum then came out the restroom, finished her coffee tipped the waiter and we walked out that diner. It's been 3 years and I still cringe whenever I think about it...",
        "I asked this girl, we\u2019re both in our early 20s. Granted I never approach girls unless she drops the most nuclear signal to me, I am still a bit hesitant. I met her as I as strolling the mall. She worked at one of these makeup stands and actually approached me. She could tell my ethnicity granted we\u2019re from the same native countries and that\u2019s of course how the conversation started. She was 22 yrs old. petite and incredibly attractive and I took her approach as a signal. But, I didn\u2019t ask her out at that moment.\n\nI came by again a month later (to make it appear less conspicuous). I was dressed much nicer and had some nice cologne (never too much of it). I\u2019m no expert with women but\u2026this one felt like you had me at hello. So, I approached her and asked for her number. (What are the chances she happened to be there that night, I never even considered).\n\nBut she was there and she gave me a resounding NO. This was the no that could be heard around the world. I was a bit shocked. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I mean earlier, she approached me at the mall, I didn\u2019t approach her and now she\u2019s rejecting me. I tried to spin my request gently by telling her\u2026I\u2019m just trying to network and meet people. And of course she said no again. She was never going to give me her number. So, I immediately realized\u2026take the L and get out. But wait there\u2019s more\u2026\n\nAfter rejecting me, she attempts to sell me her makeup products with the sales pitch that it would do me better with women. She identifies the minor flaws in my 23 yr old facial skin and points to it\u2026and how her miracle product would clear all that. I\u2019m about 5\u20198, 142lbs, eat healthy and I workout regularly. I consider myself above-average looks (I\u2019m not a model but I\u2019m not ugly). Yet, being the makeup connoisseur that she is, I was of course ugly and needed her products. Add insult to injury. That was her persuasive sales pitch. Now, I\u2019m even in more shock. The humiliation is too much and I\u2019m looking for a jet pack. There\u2019s actually even more to this story that I\u2019m too ashamed to admit (I might share it if anyone cares to hear it but doubt it). I never imaged a harmless approach would drag months later, but it did. I will skip past the ending and just say THE END.",

        " This is the second chapter to my story Must I be the Villainess? You can find the first chapter on my page [r/Abriella\\_Castoda](https://www.reddit.com/r/Abriella_Castoda/).\n\nWhen I woke up I could feel something was wrong. Not just feel it. I could see it too. I just didn\u2019t want to believe it. I sat there not wanting to open my eyes a second time. Of course I couldn\u2019t stay that way but I tried. The maid sitting beside me saw me open my eyes the first time and she pestered me until I opened them again. Like a good faithful servant she didn\u2019t want her aster falling back into the coma she had been in. I didn\u2019t know this at the time though. I was scared. I knew this wasn\u2019t my home, nor the hospital. All I could remember was getting hit by a truck, and now I\u2019m in a strange place. Now as much as I read about isekai dramas I always imagined I\u2019d accept it right away. Honestly, no one in their right mind would. Once I finally opened my eyes for the poor maid she called for the doctor and the masters of the house. I\u2019ll never forget what I felt when I heard her say my name.\n\n\u201cSORA IS AWAKE!\u201d All I could think about was the last book I had read. I looked around. The description of the room matched. Everything in soft pinks and whites. A bit f gold here and there. The room is fit for a noble. I spotted a body length mirror on the other side of the room. I try my hardest to move over to it but for the moment my body isn\u2019t complying. A spark of hope. *Maybe it isn\u2019t true? She could walk. If I can't then it\u2019s different!* I thought desperately hoping I\u2019m not really in the world I think I am. Everyone rushed in at once.\n\nThe family doctor and the masters of the house. The doctor examined me while the masters\u2026 er\u2026 my parents? Questioned me in a stand-offish, proper way.\n\n\u201cHow do you feel? Can you move?\u201d A woman with long ivory hair, green eyes and a heavier stature asked. My mother? I think. She is dressed to the t. An older style of dress, corsets, fancy heavy dresses and jewelry.\n\n\u201cDoctor. Why does she not speak?\u201d A tall man with black hair and blue eyes asks. He is probably my father based on the fact he is also dressed to the t\u2019s and the woman is hanging on him. He also seems to be calling the shots.\n\n\u201cShe is most likely still in shock. Her accident was only yesterday. I thought she would have been out much longer than this. You have a miracle on your hands.\u201d The kind looking doctor says. He is young, which is unusual in the stories. He is handsome. A man who is average height, he has slightly curly brown hair with hazel eyes. He has dimples and he is taking care to be extra gentle.\n\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d I croak, my voice is still unsteady. He stares at me in shock for a moment but then answers.\n\n\u201cArden Pruitt madam at your service. Are you uncomfortable anywhere?\u201d He smiles down at me and to the servant he asks \u201cWater please ma\u2019am\u201d The servant rushes out of the room to fetch it for him.\n\n\u201cNo, though I tried to move earlier and I couldn\u2019t.\u201d I glanced down at my legs and he followed my gaze.\n\n\u201cMay I?\u201d He asks, hovering over my legs for a minute. I nod and he examines my legs as well. After a moment he starts to massage them. The lady of the house gasps and tugs at her husband's arm.\n\n\u201cThe nerve!\u201d Doctor Pruitt glances at her and responds in a kind but matter of fact tone.\n\n\u201cHer legs are numb, she would like to walk and you wanted her to move earlier. This will be the fastest way madam.\u201d She huffed and allowed him to continue. Her husband stood unphased the whole time. After a moment I started to feel my legs again and I slid them off the bed. Doctor Pruitt backs up allowing me to stand but he only moves a step away, ready to catch me if need be. I try to walk but I\u2019m still unsteady so I reach a hand out for Doctor Pruitt. He steps forward. \u201cWhere to, my lady?\u201d He smiles sweetly.\n\n\u201cYour bedside manner is phenomenal.\u201d I stare into his eyes and he laughs. I point over to the mirror. First thing is first, I need to make sure I am wrong about who I am right now. He slowly leads me to the mirror and my hopes sink as I see myself. Wavy ivory hair like my mother and blue eyes like my father. A pear shaped figure and three birthmarks lining my collar bone on the left side. This leaves no doubt in my mind. I am Sora Habicht. The villainess of the last book I read. She tortured the first male lead, the commoner turned knight. She was killed by the second male lead, the prince. I think he ended up using the excuse of contempt against the royal family but in reality he killed her for messing with the heroine. One of her tricks backfired and the prince stepped in the way. *I\u2019m going to die.* \u201cHa!\u201d I started laughing hysterically and slipped into a panic attack. I slumped down but Doctor Pruitt didn\u2019t let me fall. I started hyperventilating and crying.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d My mother screeched. Everyone lunged forward only for the doctor to yell in a commanding voice\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t crowd her!\u201d Everyone stood in place not daring to move a muscle. Doctor Pruitt bent down to my eye level and in a soft voice began to speak to me. At first I couldn\u2019t understand what he was. Slowly as I calmed down a bit, I realized he was switching from small commands to little facts. \u201cCan you touch the ground for me? Here, yes\u201d He gently moved my hand to the cold floor. \u201cThat\u2019s cold isn\u2019t it? Did you know that coconuts kill more people than sharks? Here, smell this.\u201d He puts a small bag to my nose. It smells like lavender. \u201cAh, it looks like you recognize this scent. It\u2019s lavender. Did you know, in the language of flowers lavender symbolizes gracefulness, elegance, calmness, creativity, vitality, optimism and youthfulness? I am using it for its calming effect though.\u201d His soft unending stream of commands and facts calmed me a bit. I was terrified but this kind man tried his best to calm me. My father stepped up.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth made her react that way?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea. Her head was hurt during the accident but not to this extent.\u201d He looked down at me. \u201cDo you feel a bit better?\u201d I wiped my tears and nodded my head. *Crying won\u2019t solve anything. I need a plan*. \u201cI\u2019m going to carry you to bed now. I suggest you stay there for at least another day. I will come visit you until you feel better. How does that sound?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds lovely. Thank you Doctor Pruitt.\u201d He scoops me up in a princess carry and gently lays me on the bed. He hands me the glass of water he called for a while ago and turns to the others in the room.\n\n\u201cYou and you.\u201d He points to the maid who was in my room before I woke up and the maid who brought the water.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d they responded in unison\n\n\u201cI need someone near her at all times. Without invading her privacy I need a full report on how she does. If she has another episode like today or any other strange happenings, I need to know.\u201d The maids bow their heads in response. \u201cWhat are your names?\u201d\n\n\u201cMary,\u201d The first maid who was in my room answered.\n\n\u201cLily\u201d The maid with the water answered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d he nods to them. He turns to me and says finally \u201cYour fall was definitely difficult and I am worried it\u2019s done more damage than I can see. If anything is off call for me immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay I\u2026 have the scent pouch?\u201d I surprised him and myself by asking for it. He chuckles after a moment and hands me the small pouch of lavender. Bows as a goodbye and then he leaves the room.\n\nOne thing is for certain. Doctor Pruitt is neither of the male leads. I say this because he is kind to me.\n\nThe next chapter will be out on Saturday October 16th! You can find it here or follow to keep track!",
        " You always read about the isekai manga and online comics. It always ends up with the villainess trying to escape death and she ends up finding love. Unfortunately I was yeeted into the book\u2026 but the male leads hate me. This story won\u2019t turn out like the others. I don\u2019t get the male lead and I\u2019m not sad about it. Here is my story. Read it well.\n\nI was originally an American. I went about life working as a caregiver for children. Yes, I worked at a daycare. My hobbies were writing, reading and sometimes art. This part is normal. I guess truck-kun decided to have a vacation but he couldn\u2019t stop killing. Haha. Sorry, bad joke. I was reading this book called {Book Name}. I had the green light to walk across the street but, truck-kun plowed me over. Of course I fell into the book I was reading or we wouldn\u2019t be here. I never made it to the end but here\u2019s what I do know. I know I fell into the novel as the villainess, I know how she dies, and I know all of the male leads. Let\u2019s try to make the best of this.\n\nThe ideal for falling into a novel is to fall in early. Before the plot has taken place and before the damage to your reputation has been done. I, however, was not so lucky. I fell into the novel at 16 long after I had bullied the first male lead, burned bridges with the second male lead, BUT before the female lead had arrived, thankfully. SO my goal is to get away from the two male leads and live. UNFORTUNATELY, again, I am nobility\u2026 that means I have to go to certain parties and functions. Fortunately I am not the prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9 though. Now, This is a lot of information to take in. I\u2019ll start with when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first chapter of Must I be a Villainess? The second Chapter will be out in just a moment. You can find it here or follow my page to keep up to date!",
        "My Ex Owes me $10,193.30.\n\nLike the title says, my ex owes me $10,193.30.\n\nNow that I have your attention, I have always wanted to and felt I needed to share my story and hope that it some way, some how, helps someone else. \n\nIn 2018, I began seeing someone I worked with. He was much older than me, but I didn\u2019t care about the age gap. The connection between us was undeniable. It was one of those relationships that happened by mistake and completely unforced. It was so natural. We would talk mostly work related but in August of 2018, following the suicide of his brother, we were suddenly talking on a more personal level. \n\nCome September and October, we were talking every single day. Phone calls, texts, all of it. We made several plans that fell through due to him working at the police department, deaths in the family, etc. You name it, it ruined our plans at least once.\n\nI\u2019m an understanding person and I get that life happens so I would usually just let these things go. I can\u2019t say I never got discouraged or even slightly suspicious. Like, how was it that legitimately EVERY SINGLE TIME we had plans, something came up?\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s meant to be, it will be\u201d I kept telling myself. The way I felt was undeniable, I had to just go with the flow if I wanted this to work out. Life happens, right?\n\nFinally in mid October, I got to see him for the first time since June. I brought a vehicle up to him for work and met him at the warehouse he worked at in our company and we just talked for two hours. It wasn\u2019t a date and it wasn\u2019t romantic, but it felt good. I felt like I was at home. The conversation was natural and it flowed and there was never an awkward silence. He told me how his first wife cheated on him and his second wife was awful to him. But he\u2019d been single since 2016 and at this point he had almost given up.\n\nBut then I came around. I changed his outlook.\n\nHe kissed me goodbye and for the entire ride home, I couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off of my face. No relationship I\u2019d been in previously came even remotely close to how this felt. This was it. \n\nFast forward to the end of the year. By this time, we were in a relationship, he had lost his nephew to suicide as he hadn\u2019t been handling the death of his father well (my ex\u2019s brother who had previously passed) and he had quit his job at the company we worked for. In the middle of all of these things, our plans to see each other were constantly cancelled because of his personal life as well as his demanding schedule at the police department and our job. I often had plans cancelled because his son needed him for something. Who was I to say no? His life was just so crazy, you can\u2019t make this shit up.\n\nBut I was willing. I was willing and able to push through all of it. He wanted me and I wanted him. I was reminded on a daily basis that I was incredible, I made him realize he could love life again and that he couldn\u2019t wait to spend his life with me.\n\nSo he asked me to move in with him.\n\nWas it too soon? A little. Did he live two hours away on the other side of the state? Yes. Did I do it anyway because I truly felt that he was it for me? Yes I did. \n\nMy last day in the corporate office of that company, the day before I was supposed to move, something happened. His ex-wife had regained possession of their house. Even though he owned it, she had stolen cash receipts from when they had paid the taxes on the house and it was now considered a marital home. He had not upheld a few parts of their divorce decree. He was in contempt and there was nothing we could do but fight her.\n\nHe had a trust fund following the wrongful death of his father many years prior. He was prepared to pay her housing for a year instead of the six months she was being granted. He was going to buy her a new car like the decree stated as well as her heath insurance for a year. We were prepared to do just about anything.\n\nI moved out there anyway, living in hotels. I couldn\u2019t let the owner of the company down as he had moved me to the other location to assist and to keep me in the company. I was going out there to help and that\u2019s what I was going to do, if it killed me. \n\nMy ex was in touch with a lawyer his mother had used once before she passed and was using him to get his (now our) house back. We just wanted to go home.\n\nBecause he was in contempt of his divorce decree and was unable to pay her right away due to the trust fund taking longer than expected to transfer the money, he had to go to jail. He was being held for contempt like a lawyer would. \n\nIt started out with him only going on the weekends and then he would be with me during the week, still living in a hotel. We made the best of what we had. I would leave the warehouse at night and he would leave his job and we\u2019d come \u201chome\u201d to each other. Every night. Until the weekends came and I went home, and he went to jail.\n\nThis went on for awhile. There even came a point where he was in jail for two months straight and I didn\u2019t see him at all. I was on the emails with the lawyer and my ex begging him to do ANYTHING to help us through this. What did we need to do? What did I need to do?\n\nThis put a huge strain on my relationship with my parents. I mistook concern for judgement and wouldn\u2019t send them updates. I stayed with an incredible friend of mine and her husband who took me in like the lost puppy I was. I am forever grateful and in their debt for all they did for me during this time. \n\nI ended up leaving my job at the company and got a new job up in that area. I reached a point where I stopped being able to afford hotels. My credit cards were maxed out, both of my checking accounts were in the negative and my ex wasn\u2019t working due to him being in jail so he was unable to assist me financially. I began commuting two hours to and from work everyday. He assured me when his money came in from the trust we would pay off all of my debts. This made me feel better.\n\nMy new boss caught wind of this and graciously invited me into her home and allowed me to stay in her guest bedroom quite often so I didn\u2019t have to commute. I kept her in the loop on everything.\n\nThe most common question I was asked was, \u201cHow\u2019s Ryan doing?\u201d\n\nThe only answer I ever had was a shrug and \u201cI\u2019m honestly not sure.\u201d\n\nPeople are probably thinking \u201che just casually went in and out of jail? That\u2019s not how jail works!\u201d How was I supposed to know? I\u2019ve had four serious relationships before him and none of them ever went to jail. I\u2019VE never been to jail. What did I know?\n\nI was getting bad vibes. I was questioning the legitimacy of everything. The deaths in his family, the court case we were involved in, everything. Things weren\u2019t adding up. It didn\u2019t take me this long to get suspicious; I\u2019d felt it on and off and each time I voiced it to him, he reassured me that it was all real. He had an answer for everything; a good one.\n\nMid-April of 2019 I reached out to my ex\u2019s sister-in-law, the one that had been married to his brother that had commit suicide. I had to ask her if her husband was still alive. His Facebook page prompted me to ask this. He seemed to be alive. Pictures were being updated, people were commenting and not as though he had passed. \n\nShe confirmed that he was alive. She confirmed that her son, my ex\u2019s nephew, was still alive. She told me my ex was still married. I didn\u2019t believe her. I denied anything she said about him being married. I didn\u2019t want to hear it. He wouldn\u2019t do that to me.\n\nI was hurt. I was furious. To be honest, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t leave. Maybe because we had made it this far; how could I give up now? I now knew he\u2019d lied, and he didn\u2019t have a good answer as to why\u2026so why didn\u2019t I leave? My gut was screaming at me to leave, but my heart was set in stone. It was hard, and my trust levels were very low, but I stayed. I tried to make it work. How foolish.\n\nIn May, I started working from home two days a week and went back to the company I loved part-time. I had previously tried to get in the door in my old position but due to the way I left (abruptly) it was denied, so I was happy to be back even if I was just part-time and on-call. \n\nThis went on into July 2019. I hadn\u2019t seen my ex since mid-April. I was frustrated. I just wanted him out of jail and for us to go home. I wanted this nightmare over. The lawyer assured us that it would be over soon, that the last seven months were hard but it would be over soon and he was doing everything he could. \n\nThree weeks into July, I reached out to his sister-in-law again and I asked her if she could call me. I was ready to listen. I gave her my phone number and I waited. She agreed to call me. A week went by and nothing happened. No call.\n\nI was on my way back from Connecticut for my part-time job when she finally called. My heart fluttered with nothing but anxiety. But I answered. She reconfirmed that her husband and son were alive. I told her everything that was going on with my ex. I spilled everything. She told me it was all a lie. The trust fund wasn\u2019t real, the court case wasn\u2019t real. I was shaking. I causally mentioned something in passing about him being a police officer and she said, \u201cWait, who is a police officer?\u201d I paused and then said \u201cWell supposedly Ryan\u201d. She kind of sighed and said no, he wasn\u2019t a police officer and that her husband was, but not my ex. Her son was never in New Hampshire in September like he supposedly was (another reason for cancelled plans).\n\nIt was all a lie. Everything.\n\nI knew things weren\u2019t right, but I didn\u2019t think it was going to be this bad.\nNot once did I think that LITERALLY everything was going to be a lie.\n\nI somehow managed to hold myself together until the end of the call. Barely. But as soon as we hung up, I just cried. I drove back to the office having a full blown mental breakdown. \n\nI called my ex once I\u2019d clocked out and confronted him. I told him I knew everything and that I\u2019d talked to his sister-in-law and that no, I wasn\u2019t bluffing. I really knew everything. He finally spilled.\n\nHere I am in December. Here, barely, but I\u2019m here.\n\nHe was never a police officer.\nHis brother did not commit suicide.\nHis nephew did not commit suicide.\nHis trust fund was not real.\nThe supposed court case was not real.\nHe was still married and living with her the whole time.\nHe was never in jail.\nHe was the \u201clawyer\u201d behind the emails.\n\nMy entire life for 10 months was not real. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s still considered cheating if I was the other woman, but it still hurts just as badly. He told his brother that he had an affair. All I was was an affair. I was being used.\n\nI have filed and won a small claims case against him and he owes me $10,193.30. I will not stop until that debt has been paid back to me. Money isn\u2019t going to heal the severe emotional damage done, but it will at least alleviate the financial burden.\n\nI\u2019m not here to get any pity from anyone. I made the choice to stay and ignore the red flags. So I hope someone out there reading this listens to their gut and does not ignore red flags. No matter what the situation is. Bad vibes are real and your body picks up on them. LISTEN TO THEM! Do not make the same mistakes I did. I promise you, the fantasy, likely to not come true, in your head is not worth the heavy downfall when things go very wrong.\n\nI will heal from this someday. But it\u2019s going to be awhile before that happens. Regardless of how he treated and felt for me, the love I had for him was, at the time, very real. Wrapping my head around the fact that someone I loved could do this to me hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\nPlease do not ignore red flags and bad vibes. Please.\n\nI hope someone benefits from reading this. \n\nTL;DR : I dated a sociopath who lied about literally everything in our relationship and owes me a lot of money.",

        "# [Humans are Weird: We Took A Vote BOOK 2 | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)\n\n# [Humans are Weird - Supply and Demand - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/8YcF15klGdI)\n\nThe gleaming green sunlight was just angling down for the afternoon when Flight Subcommander Twenty Clicks discovered that one of the humans had eaten the entire supply of acidic calcium supplements for the base. He had the holo-record right in front of him. He scratched the control screen one more time just to be sure of what he was seeing. It was a fairly simple situation on the fringes of the air mass.\n\nThe human had been on duty in the supply bay. It had been his job to fill all material requests for the base. Humans were exceptionally well-adapted for this duty. Their height alone made working in the warehouses an easy matter for them. Their truly terrifying compressive strength meant that they ignored the lifting machines most of the time in favor of manually filling the orders. They were more likely to send the drones for the smaller packages than for the larger ones. Twenty Clicks had once seen a human lift an entire shelving unit full of prefabricated building cores simply to retrieve a scrap of paper that the human immediately tossed in the recycler.\n\nTwenty Clicks scratched the control again to watch the scene over, trying to understand. The human was what they called middle-aged. Not yet out of his reproductive cycle but past the prime of his breeding age. His hair was beginning to thin on the top of his head in a way that made him look dull and scattered. His uniform was clean but rumpled. He was sprawled across the chair he was nominally sitting in. He had forced two of the supports off of the ground and was bracing the unbalanced position by resting his legs on a nearby storage crate. In one hand he held a datapad, which the helpful AI indicated was displaying one of the popular theoretical social simulations. The other hand was otherwise occupied.\n\nTwenty Clicks watched in fascination as the massive hand, easily as large as one of his wings, lifted from where it rested on the human\u2019s thigh and drifted almost as if not under the control of the massive mammalian brain towards the open bag of calcium citrate supplements that rested beside the human on a crate. The hand, all the time out of range of the human\u2019s binocular vision, drifted over and past the bag till it reached nearly the full range of the human\u2019s flexibility, then drifted back and began to make short passes in the general location of the bag.\n\nThis was clearly Undulate behavior, or perhaps it would be if the Undulate was old and blinded to visible light and was feeling around for something. Yet Twenty Clicks had checked, and the human had spent only a nominal amount of training time with the Undulates. What this actually resembled was the slow groping reach of a vine-type plant for some secure hold. Twenty Clicks wondered if human hands had an autonomous search function. To think of that massive crushing power under the control of plant-like chemical signals was terrifying.\n\nOn the display, the hand brushed over the band and flexed to reach into the interior, moving more confidently now that it had tactile information. The hand closed over what the humans called a \u201chandful\u201d of the supplements. Enough to supply a dozen humans for a month. However the wandering hand slowly lifted them to the human\u2019s mouth and began pushing the mass of supplements into a mouth that opened slackly to admit them. The human chewed approximately half the mass for several moments before swallowing with a massive gulp.\n\nThe hand then pressed in the rest, and even as the mouth chewed, the hand drifted back down to the bag. It groped around with slightly slower motions this time and pulled in another handful of supplements. This process repeated itself a few dozen times until the bag was empty. When the hand finally found no more supplements in the bag, it returned to the slack, rest position on his leg. It rested there for several moments.\n\nHowever the inevitable consequence of ingesting that much calcium and ascorbic acid was quickly taking its toll on even the legendary metabolism of the human. His skin paled as his digestive system pulled blood to his gut to deal with the unexpected meal. The muscles around his eyes tightened and strained for a few moments. Then his mouth contracted in a grimace. The hand busy holding the datapad gave a spasm. The guilty hand rose and clutched at the human\u2019s abdomen over the general location of his primary stomach. He narrowed his eyes and looked down at his abdomen with a perplexed expression.\n\n\u201cWhat the ever loving?\u201d he muttered.\n\nHe glanced over at the empty bag of supplements, and his face contorted with unease and perhaps guilt; Twenty Clicks was unsure. The human rose to his feet, staggering in place of his usual graceful movements. His guilty hand reached around to clutch his abdomen as he staggered to the comm unit on the wall. He braced one shoulder against the wall and carefully pulled up the supplies manifest. He typed in an order for an emergency refill on the supplies, hesitated when he came to the section in the form that requested a reason, and after a moment typed in \u2018accidental destruction.\u2019 The human then staggered back to his seat and collapsed in it with a groan. He stayed there for the rest of his shift, and Twenty Clicks let the recording play until it showed his own wings flitting into the storage area to request a new carry harness.\n\nHe sighed as he turned off the recording. He had of course ordered the recalcitrant human to the medical bay, and the Shatar medic on duty had soon relieved the human\u2019s distress with an orally administered oil flush. It had seemed extreme to the Winged, but the Shatar and the human both agreed it was the safest method to cleanse his digestive tract of the calcium buildup. After the treatment, when Twenty Clicks had pressed for an explanation, the human had only shrugged.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice what I was doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good book.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Humans are Weird - Supply and Demand - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/8YcF15klGdI)\n\nBook 1 \"[\u200b](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)Humans are Weird: I Have the Data\"\n\n[Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RSVHL81)\n\n[Barnes & Nobe (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/humans-are-weird-adelia-gibadullina/1138927933;jsessionid=CED1CA2DD868CAE60C7F4EAC8FEDD5E5.prodny_store01-atgap01?ean=9781736003923)\n\n[Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=USta%20eBook%20by%20Betty%20Adams%20-%201230004645337%20%7C%20Rakuten%20Kobo%20United%20States)\n\n[Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# [Humans are Weird: We Took A Vote BOOK 2 | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humans-are-weird-we-took-a-vote-more-absurdity/coming_soon/x/20737048)",

        "I was in a drug store one night, picking up a couple of things I needed and, while standing in line to pay, was forced to listen to one of the loudest, most obnoxious young women I've ever encountered. After prefacing her statements by stating that she was \u201cNOT a racist\u201d, she proceeded to spout things that were at least borderline racist in intent, to the two young men who were with her (they were all in their early 20s at best guess).\n\nFinally, out of the blue, she announces, at the top of her lungs to the entire store, \"I just want to say to everyone that I'm still a virgin...because I don't want to expose myself to all those crackheads and all those diseases they have.\"\n\nI probably should have kept my mouth shut, but my mouth apparently felt otherwise and it just slipped out - I said, \"I suppose the real problem might be that the crackheads are the only ones who want to have sex with you.\" \n\nShe and both guys who were with her spun around with venom in their eyes.\n\nThe funniest part was that, since the tallest guy was probably 5'6 and weighed maybe 150, they all spun around to find themselves staring at my chest - then having to look up to see my face (I\u2019m 6\u20194\u201d & around 250).\n\nThey all three quickly turned back around...paid the cashier...and hurried out the door.\n\nThe first thing the teenage cashier said to me was, \"I wish I had videoed that on my phone. It would have gone viral.\"\n\nOh, the world we live in...",
        "You guys really liked [my last story](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/q5mhpy/guy_wastes_half_an_hour_by_not_listening_to_a_girl/) so here's another one.\n\nThe story starts with a police detective we'll call Bob talking to a man who owned a local landscaping company (we'll call him Dale) and Dale's employee (who we'll call Joe). Bob asks me (13 years old at the time) if he can ask me a few questions. I said sure. He asked where my parents were. I told him my mom was out of the country on a cruise and my dad was at work and wouldn't be home for another couple of hours. He asked me if I lived nearby, I said yeah and pointed to my house (behind me) and told him the house number. Joe, in something of a frenzy, said \"LOOK! She's got grease on her pants! Ask her about the grease on her pants!\" The detective was like \"I can do my own job, thank you\", and asked about the grease on my pants. I told him that I hadn't noticed it but it was probably from my bike chain. \"Where's your bike now?\" Bob asked. \"I put it away. I'd been riding for a few hours and I was tired.\" Joe yells: \"I bet she wiped it off to destroy the evidence!!\" The detective addresses Joe and tells him that if he has any more outbursts he'll be removed from the scene. I still wasn't quite sure what this was all about but I was starting to figure it out.\n\nThe detective gestures to a lawnmower. \"Have you seen that lawnmower before?\" I told him that I didn't know, the mowers look pretty much the same. The only thing that differentiates them is their ID tags. I asked if the machine was one of those that Dale's company had been using to mow the neighborhood today. Detective Bob responds, \"Yes. Joe says it's got broken brakes. Do you know how that happened?\" \"What do you think happened?\" I asked Joe--now I was almost certain I knew what was going on. \"I went to get some trash from in front of the mower, and it chased me around because you broke the brakes! You were sitting there on your bike laughing!\"\n\n\"You had turned on the brakes?\" I asked. Joe angrily insisted, \"OF COURSE!\" I asked him where the brakes were. Joe retorts: \"Like you don't know!\" I insisted that he pointed to the brakes. The detective tried to butt in and asks me: \"Can you tell me what happened in your own words?\" I knew that the easiest way to clear this up would be to get Dale to understand what I'd seen, so I refused to answer any more questions until Joe pointed to the control for the brakes. Now Dale was looking at Joe and seemed a little confused. \"Just point out the brakes so we can get on with this.\"\n\nSo Joe pointed--but not at the brakes. He pointed at one of the two handles that controlled direction. The brake control was underneath it. Dale, suddenly concerned, says: \"You're \\*sure\\* that's the brake you pulled?\" \"Of course I'm sure, now what did she do to it?\" Dale's face had gone pale and I knew that he was fully aware of what had happened now. He looked over at me. \"And of course you know where the brakes are\" he groaned. The detective asked if I could go point to the brakes without touching them. I did. But I pointed at the actual control. \"Wait, which of them is right?\" the detective asked Dale. \"She is\" Dale said. \"And how do you know so much about these lawnmowers?\" the detective asked me. \"From my dad.\" Dale interjects that my dad owned a competing company and that his trucks were at my house all the time. I nodded. The detective started scribbling in his notepad furiously.\n\nThe detective asked if I could go over what had happened now in my own words. I told him: \"I was riding my bike and Joe was mowing a lawn. He stopped to pick up some litter, but he didn't use the brake, he used the turn gear, so instead of stopping the mower just turned and started chasing him. I stopped to watch because I thought it was really funny.\" \"And you never even touched the brakes\" Dale said, his ego fully deflated. I turned to Dale: \"I wasn't going to let Joe do any damage or hurt anyone. The machine wasn't going very fast, the blades weren't exposed, and it wasn't near anything it could run into. If I'd known that he was the kind of idiot who would take control of a 500 lb machine without knowing how to stop it then I would've turned it off for you. I thought when he got back behind the machine he'd realize what he did wrong.\"\n\nThe detective put his pen in his pocket and closed his notebook. \"So, let me get this straight. Your employee, through his own gross incompetence, managed to fail to engage the brakes on your mower. He broke your mower trying to stop it. Then he tried to blame the whole thing on your competitor's *child*. Am I missing anything?\" \"My FORMER employee.\" Bob says that as there's nothing more for him to do he'll be on his way.\n\nThe boss looked at me with a hint of fear in his eyes. I think he was probably imagining the next day's headlines: \"How far would you go to keep up with the Joneses? Would you try to have their minor child arrested for your own employee's bad behavior? One local businessman is accused of doing just that! More at 11.\"\n\nDale looked at me. \"Please don't tell your dad about this. Is there anything I can get you?\" \"Some ice cream would be nice.\" \"Ice cream, ok, I'll go get it. I'll just add that to the things I'm docking from Joe's pay: breaking my mower, wasting my time and the detective's time...\" He just trailed off. He drove to McDonald's, bought me a sundae, brought it back to me and told me I was a good kid.\n\nI didn't end up telling my parents the story for years because I considered the matter closed and because I liked that it was a hilarious anecdote that only I knew. After Dale finally retired, he took the time to thank my dad for not destroying him when he had the chance which my dad found confusing but I responded simply with \"You're welcome.\" My dad was like \"Uh, yeah, you're welcome?\"",

Timmy uses electrical energy provided by the socket to make toast. As he usually works in the morning, he must remember to charge before going to work.\n\nWhilst toasting the bread, Timmy turns the electric energy into heat energy, or more uncommonly known as thermal. This makes the bread brown, and also confirms discrimination among bread exists.\n\nAfter the bread is completely burnt or still white, Timmy uses some elastic energy to make the toast pop out, only for the toast craving person to miss it, and stick their fingers in Timmy to get their toast. The person may then use Kinetic energy to smack Timmy out of frustration because their fingers are burnt.  \nTimmy, after a long day of toasting, uses his electric car to go home. When he arrives, he uses kinetic energy to stop the car, maybe producing some Thermal energy whilst doing so.
